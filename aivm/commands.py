"""Centralized command orchestration, logging, and approval handling.

This module is the long-term home for subprocess execution in ``aivm``.
It organizes command output around user-meaningful plans and intent
contexts while still preserving raw command visibility for deeper
debugging.

The main entry point is :class:`CommandManager`, which coordinates
command submission, grouped plan execution, and privileged-operation
approval prompts.

# TODO: The current command role model is too coarse.
# don't execute on this, this needs more thought. Current ideas written here.
#
# Right now roles mostly collapse into "read" vs "modify", but in practice
# there are at least two separate axes we care about:
#
# 1. privilege boundary
#    - unprivileged
#    - privileged / sudo
#
# 2. effect boundary
#    - read / inspect
#    - system write
#    - user-file write
#
# These should not be conflated. Some operations are unprivileged but still
# deserve explicit approval because they modify user-owned files (for example
# SSH config or other dotfiles). Other operations are privileged but read-only
# and may be safe to auto-approve in some contexts.
#
# Future design:
# - replace the coarse role model with a richer action / approval model
# - allow step-level approval policy to be explicit instead of only inferred
# - distinguish "touches user files" from "touches system state"
# - distinguish "requires sudo" from "is a write"
