Workflows
=========

Common daily workflows.

Open project in VM
------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   aivm code .
   aivm vm code .

These shortcut flows now report progress as grouped steps. Expect a current
step title, a short explanation of why that step is happening, semantic command
summaries, and the exact commands that will run. Privileged host changes prompt
once for the whole step when approval is required.

For the default ``shared-root`` attachment path, the current implementation
usually breaks reconciliation into:

* inspect shared-root host bind state
* prepare host bind targets
* inspect/ensure the VM virtiofs mapping
* mount and verify the bind inside the guest

SSH into mapped directory
-------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   aivm vm ssh .
   aivm vm ssh_config

Attach folders
--------------

.. code-block:: bash

   aivm attach .
   aivm detach .
   aivm vm attach --vm aivm-2404 --host_src . --guest_dst /workspace/project
   aivm attach . --mode git

``aivm code`` / ``aivm ssh`` restore the requested folder and attempt to
remount the VM's other saved folder attachments after reboot.

Attachment modes:

* ``shared-root`` (default for new attachments): one persistent VM virtiofs
  mapping and per-folder host/guest bind mounts.
* ``shared``: direct per-folder virtiofs mapping.
* ``git``: guest-local Git clone synced by host/guest remotes.

``--mode git`` switches the attachment to a normal guest-local repo. That
avoids a writable host share and adds a host-side Git remote pointing at the
guest repo. ``aivm`` configures the guest side with
``receive.denyCurrentBranch=updateInstead`` so the host can push committed
branch state into the checked-out guest repo and fetch guest commits later.
Git-mode default guest paths are chosen under ``/home/<vm-user>/...`` so sync
does not depend on root-owned guest paths; use ``--guest_dst`` to override.

Major limitation: shared folder count
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each ``shared`` folder consumes a dedicated virtiofs device mapping. Large
attachment sets can exhaust VM device-slot capacity (for example PCI/PCIe
slots), causing attach/restore failures such as
``No more available PCI slots``.

``shared-root`` reduces this pressure by using a single persistent virtiofs
mapping per VM.

If this happens, prefer ``--mode git`` for some folders, detach unused shared
folders, or split the workload across multiple VMs.

Attachment mode rules:

* New folder defaults to ``shared-root`` when ``--mode`` is omitted.
* Existing folder reuses its saved mode when ``--mode`` is omitted.
* Changing mode for an existing folder requires explicit detach + reattach.
  Passing a different ``--mode`` directly now returns an error.

``aivm code --mode git .`` specifics:

* New folder: attaches in ``git`` mode, with default guest path under
  ``/home/<vm-user>/...``.
* Previously attached ``shared``/``shared-root`` folder: errors until you detach
  and reattach in ``git`` mode.
* No explicit mode (``aivm code .``): use saved mode when present, else create a
  new ``shared-root`` attachment.

.. code-block:: bash

   aivm detach .
   aivm attach . --mode git

Attachment access modes:

* ``rw`` (default): read-write access to the shared folder.
* ``ro``: read-only access; currently supported only for ``shared`` mode.

Specify access with ``--access``:

.. code-block:: bash

   aivm attach . --access ro

Inspect and list resources
--------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   aivm status
   aivm status --detail
   aivm list
   aivm list --section vms
   aivm list --section networks
   aivm list --section folders

Manage config store
-------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   aivm config show
   aivm config edit
   aivm config discover

Sync host settings into guest
-----------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   aivm vm sync_settings
   aivm vm sync-settings --paths "~/.gitconfig,~/.tmux.conf"

Reconcile VM drift
------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   aivm vm update

Workflow logging model
----------------------

``aivm`` command execution is organized around:

* nested intent context, which keeps the larger goal visible
* step/plan previews, which describe what the current sequence of commands is
  about to do and show the exact commands that will run
* raw commands, which remain visible for deeper inspection at higher verbosity

This is meant to make multi-command workflows easier to follow and safer to
approve than a stream of isolated sudo command prompts. Shared-root
attach/reconcile is the most complete example today; some older helper flows
still rely on the compatibility shim while migration continues.

Interactive approval semantics:

* ``y`` approves the current block only
* ``a`` approves the current block and all later blocks
* ``s`` shows the full exact commands for the current block, then reprompts

Normal previews are intentionally readable and may abbreviate long shell blobs,
but the full exact commands can be shown before approval and are always logged
when they execute. For ``shared-root`` attachments, host-side preparation is
designed to avoid mutating ownership or permissions in the user's source tree.

Get command tree
----------------

.. code-block:: bash

   aivm help tree
   aivm help plan
   aivm help raw
   aivm help completion
