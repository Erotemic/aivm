Quickstart
==========

Choose one of these startup paths.

Path A: One-command project entry (recommended)
-----------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   aivm code .

Behavior:

* Uses global config store at ``~/.config/aivm/config.toml``.
* If VM context is missing, ``aivm`` can bootstrap required config/VM steps.
* Attaches current folder and opens VS Code.
* Major setup/reconcile logs are grouped into step previews so you can see what
  the current step is doing before the commands run.
* For default ``shared-root`` attachments, those steps usually include host
  bind inspection/repair, VM mapping checks, and guest mount verification.

Use this path when you want minimal setup friction.

Path B: Explicit config-store setup
-----------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   aivm config init
   aivm vm create

This path is explicit and reproducible. Here, ``aivm config init`` is required
before ``aivm vm create``.

After either path
-----------------

.. code-block:: bash

   aivm status
   aivm status --sudo
   aivm vm update

Notes
-----

* ``status --sudo`` enables privileged checks (libvirt/network/firewall/image).
* Privileged operations prompt unless ``--yes`` or ``--yes-sudo`` is used.
* Approvals normally happen once per grouped step, not once per command.
* Step previews show both semantic summaries and the exact commands to be run.
* ``y`` approves the current step only; ``a`` approves the current and all
  later steps.
* Raw commands are still visible at higher verbosity levels.
