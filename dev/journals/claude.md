Long session: merged the security-hardening branch into the test-reshape branch, then spent the rest of the day shaking real-host bugs out of the merged result on namek, shipped storage adoption (with one serious incident), and worked through an external review. Sixteen commits, `a037b78..edf92a2`.

### The merge

`origin/dev/sudoless` (boundary hardening, config-review streamline, doc pruning) had diverged from local (test-vocabulary reshape that deleted/split `test_vm_helpers.py` and `test_attachment_persistent.py`). Resolution rule: keep the reshaped layout, port the remote's *behavioral* coverage into it, drop formatting churn on deleted files. The interesting conflicts were semantic, not textual: the hardening namespaced nft tables per network (`effective_firewall_table`), renamed the bootstrap seam (`InitCLI.main` → `initialize_config_defaults`), and added a root-owned replay-manifest sync that the reshaped artifact-style tests then had to route.

### The sudo-friction cascade (namek)

Testing on a host *without* passwordless sudo surfaced a chain of bugs, each hiding behind the previous:

1. The sudoless e2e's dependency preflight ran `host doctor --sudo` — the suite that proves the never-sudo guarantee demanded passwordless sudo to start.
2. `sudoless check` graded the built-in `/var/lib` default instead of the storage VMs actually use, read the firewall flag from `rec.cfg.firewall` (always the default `True`; the persisted value lives on the `[[networks]]` record — `materialize_vm_cfg` is the join), and rendered policy-consistent sudo as ❌. Now mode-aware: under `'never'` sudo-costing items fail; under `'as-needed'` they're friction (⚠️), and the firewall renders 🧱 — a wall, not a fixable warning, and never "disable it" advice (it's the guest's egress containment).
3. `vm up` demanded root to create `/var/lib/aivm/persistent-host` for VMs with zero persistent attachments. Gate at the chokepoint: `_persistent_host_replay_state_needed` (records exist, or a manifest was previously installed — the second arm keeps detach-to-empty honest).
4. Two unit tests ran **real sudo** (they drove the real attach flow without faking subprocess): silent root-file creation under `/var/lib/aivm` on passwordless hosts, password-prompt failures elsewhere. Structural fix: an autouse conftest guard wraps real `subprocess.run` and fails any unit test reaching a `sudo` argv (e2e exempt via marker).

### Storage adoption and the incident

The mode-switch story ("recreate or migrate your VM") was unacceptable; shipped `sudoless setup --adopt`: chgrp the existing tree to `root:libvirt` in place, VM down/up around it (libvirt restores recorded disk ownership at shutdown, so the change must land while off). Nothing moves; the libvirt group becomes the single capability boundary.

**The incident:** the first version recursed `chgrp -R`/`chmod -R` through the tree — and attachment export roots (`<base_dir>/<vm>/{persistent,shared}-root/<token>`) are **live bind mounts of real user folders**. On namek it rewrote group/perms/ACLs across 17 attached project and dataset trees. Recovery was clean (metadata only; `chown`/`chmod g-ws`/`setfacl -b` over the `host_path` list from the store), but the failure chain is the lesson:

- My unit tests faked the subprocess boundary, so they asserted the destructive command's *text*, never its behavior.
- My "verified end-to-end" demo used a tree without binds — verified the happy path, not the deployment environment.
- During recovery I compounded it: `findmnt -R <dir>` prints *nothing* when the dir isn't itself a mountpoint — a false "no binds" all-clear. `/proc/self/mounts` is the truth source.

Fix: the privileged script reads `/proc/self/mounts` **at execution time** (the approval prompt + sudo password window is minutes long) and prunes every mountpoint from every `find` pass; refuses when the mount table is unreadable or a mountpoint name can't be handed to `find -path` literally; skips symlinks (per-entry chgrp/chmod follow links, unlike `-R`). The regression test replays the incident with a **real bind mount** (`tests/e2e/test_adopt.py`).

### findmnt never worked

The user's next report: every `aivm ssh .` prompted sudo for `mount -o remount,bind,rw` on an already-rw bind. Root cause: the host-bind probe requested `-o SOURCE,ROOT,FSTYPE,OPTIONS` — **`ROOT` is not a findmnt column** (it's `FSROOT`). Real findmnt rejected the whole invocation; every probe ever run answered "not a mountpoint"; the hardening's access check then "repaired" healthy binds each session. This dates to the original 2026-04-01 fix (see that entry — the column list was wrong from day one). The unit fakes scripted `ROOT=""` replies — faithful to a command findmnt cannot answer. Fixed to FSROOT; the probe now warns when rc≠0 arrives *with stderr* (malformed invocation can no longer masquerade as "no mount"); e2e drives the real probe against a real bind under `privilege_mode='never'` where any remount attempt raises.

### Review response (GPT 5.6)

Five findings addressed, scoped per maintainer: adoption canonicalizes+dedupes trees (`resolve()` in Python, `realpath` in-script — lexical config vs canonical mount table was a residual hole in the prune fix) and is fail-safe (unknown VM state aborts before mutation, domain-not-found proceeds, stopped VMs restart in a `finally`, setfacl required up front, traversal verified after); `acl` added to install_deps; legacy ro direct-shares get host-boundary `<readonly/>` enforcement on reconcile (access disagreement = missing mapping; `attach_vm_share`'s already-exists branch replaces the device); the pre-namespacing nft table is deleted on apply/remove (no registry — the only legacy shape is the configured name). Deliberately skipped: the mount-snapshot race across find passes (concurrent attach during interactive adoption; lock not worth it today). ty 0.0.60's `dataclasses.fields` complaint fixed with typeshed's `DataclassInstance`.

### Durable lessons

- **Fakes can be faithful to a broken command.** Twice today (ROOT column, adopt script) the recorder tests passed because they scripted replies to invocations the real tool rejects or behavior the real filesystem doesn't have. Any feature whose substance is one privileged/destructive command needs one test at the real boundary; the e2e files now model this.
- **Bind mounts live under `base_dir`.** Every recursive operation on VM storage must prune `/proc/self/mounts` entries or it rewrites user projects through the binds. `-xdev` does not help (same-device binds); `findmnt -R` on a non-mountpoint lies by omission.
- **Probe failure ≠ negative result.** findmnt exits 1 for both "no mount" and "you called me wrong"; conflating them turned a typo into a year of silent misbehavior and a per-session sudo prompt.
- Interactive `aivm ssh` no longer reports the user's shell exit status as an aivm ERROR; only ssh's own 255 is ours to report.

### Open threads

- Firewall UX decision still open: prompts vs the scoped NOPASSWD sudoers candidate (`docs/planning/candidate_ideas/nft-nopasswd-sudoers.md`).
- Design note worth writing: move attachment export roots out from under `base_dir` entirely — removes the recursive-op trap class instead of defending each operation.
- `vm move-storage` (guest-state-preserving relocation) remains ungapped if anyone actually needs relocation rather than adoption.

## 2026-04-01 21:08:53 +0000

Ported the `ae261eba` shared-root host-bind fix from the old monolithic `vm.py` to `aivm/attachments/shared_root.py`, where that code now lives after extraction. Also completed the final cleanup pass on the `split_cli_vm_refactor` branch: removed all attachment re-exports from `vm.py`, moved `_maybe_install_missing_host_deps` out of `vm.py` and into `cli/_common.py` (breaking the `session.py → cli/vm` import cycle), retargeted all stale `aivm.cli.vm.*` monkeypatch targets in the split test files to their new lookup sites, and removed two leftover `pytest.skip('Seems to freeze')` guards that were inert after earlier patch-target fixes.

### The shared-root fix (main bug)

Commit `ae261eba` improved `_ensure_shared_root_host_bind` to use `findmnt -P -n -o SOURCE,ROOT,FSTYPE` (machine-parseable key=value, multiple fields) instead of `findmnt -n -o SOURCE` (plain text, one field). The old code only checked the `SOURCE` field, which is not stable across bind-mount backends — on some filesystems it is a device name like `/dev/nvme0n1p1` with no path information, causing the health check to always fail and the bind to be treated as stale. The fix adds:

- `FindmntTargetInfo` dataclass holding `source`, `root`, `fstype`, `code`, with an `is_mountpoint` property
- `_parse_findmnt_pairs` to parse `findmnt -P` output into a dict
- `_shared_root_host_bind_matches_source` which accepts a bind as correct if any of: SOURCE candidate matches, ROOT candidate matches, or inode identity (`st_dev`/`st_ino`) matches

This fix existed in `vm.py` from `ae261eba` but was absent from `shared_root.py` because that module was extracted from an earlier commit. The regression manifested as attached devices not being restored on `aivm code .` or `aivm ssh .` after reboot on hosts where `findmnt SOURCE` returns a device name rather than a path.

### Cycle shim removal

`session.py` had a lazy-import wrapper that called `_maybe_install_missing_host_deps` from `cli.vm` at call time to avoid a module-load-time cycle. Moved the function to `cli/_common.py`, which both `session.py` and `vm.py` already import from. Both now import it normally at module load time. The remaining lazy imports in `session.py` (`VMCreateCLI` for bootstrap flow, `InitCLI`) are a separate pre-existing cycle and were not changed.

### Test patch target rule (reminder)

Patch the module where the symbol is *looked up at call time* — i.e., where it is imported into the calling function's module. Not where it was originally defined, not a re-export location. For `_ensure_shared_root_host_bind` tests: the subprocess mock is on `aivm.commands.subprocess.run`, not on any attachment module, because `CommandManager.run` resolves subprocess through its own module.

### What might be fragile

The `findmnt -P` output format is shell-quoting sensitive — values with spaces or special characters will be quoted by findmnt and must be unquoted by `shlex.split`. This is handled by `_parse_findmnt_pairs` which uses `shlex.split` on the full line. If findmnt on an unusual kernel/distro quotes differently or adds extra fields, the parser may silently drop them (dict lookup returns empty string). The stat-identity fallback provides a safety net for the most common case.

## 2026-04-01 05:20:00 +0000

Session completed the `aivm/attachments/` package extraction (structural refactor) and fixed all test monkeypatch targets.

### What was done

**Package extraction**: All attachment/session subsystem code extracted from `aivm/cli/vm.py` (3884 lines → ~1728 lines) into `aivm/attachments/`:
- `resolve.py`: path/tag/normalization helpers, `_resolve_attachment`, `_compute_mirror_home_symlink`
- `shared_root.py`: host/guest bind mechanics for shared-root mode
- `guest.py`: guest symlinks, git clone, `_ensure_attachment_available_in_guest`, `_apply_guest_derived_symlinks`
- `session.py`: `_record_attachment`, `_prepare_attached_session`, `_restore_saved_vm_attachments`, `_reconcile_attached_vm`
- `__init__.py`: minimal re-exports

`aivm/cli/vm.py` now imports from `..attachments.*` and still re-exports all symbols so existing call sites work without change.

**Test file split**: `tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py` (3103 lines) replaced by four new files:
- `tests/test_attachment_resolve.py` (26 tests)
- `tests/test_attachment_guest.py` (19 tests)
- `tests/test_attachment_shared_root.py` (12 tests)
- `tests/test_attachment_session.py` (17 tests)

**Monkeypatch fixes**: After the split, all tests that patched `aivm.cli.vm.*` were updated to patch the module where the symbol is looked up at call time:
- Functions in `guest.py`: patched at `aivm.attachments.guest.*`
- Functions in `session.py`: patched at `aivm.attachments.session.*`
- Functions in `shared_root.py`: patched at `aivm.attachments.shared_root.*`
- `Path.home` (in `_compute_mirror_home_symlink`): patched at `aivm.attachments.resolve.Path.home`
- `ensure_share_mounted` called from `_ensure_attachment_available_in_guest` (in guest.py): patched at `aivm.attachments.guest.ensure_share_mounted`
- `ensure_share_mounted` called from `_restore_saved_vm_attachments` (in session.py): patched at `aivm.attachments.session.ensure_share_mounted`
- Tests in `test_cli_vm_update.py` calling `_prepare_attached_session`: all function references updated to `aivm.attachments.session.*`

**Removed pytest.skip**: `test_vm_attach_mounts_share_when_vm_running` and `test_vm_attach_escalates_when_nonsudo_probe_inconclusive` had `pytest.skip('seems to freeze')` added previously. Once `ensure_share_mounted` was patched correctly at `aivm.attachments.guest`, both tests pass without hangs.

### Helpers left in place (not moved)

The following stay in `aivm/cli/_common.py` and are imported into `session.py` from there (no cycles):
- `PreparedSession`, `_cfg_path`, `_maybe_offer_create_ssh_identity`, `_record_vm`, `_resolve_cfg_for_code`, `_load_cfg_with_path`

The following stay in `aivm/cli/vm.py` (would cause cycles if moved to attachments):
- `_resolve_ip_for_ssh_ops`, `_record_attachment` (moved to session.py), `_maybe_install_missing_host_deps`

**Note**: `_record_attachment` was successfully moved to `session.py`. `_resolve_ip_for_ssh_ops` remains in `vm.py` since it's called from `VMAttachCLI.main()` only.

### Full suite result

261 passed, 6 skipped.

---

## 2026-03-31 20:00:00 +0000

Session implemented Pass 4 of the attachment path policy / mirror-symlink feature (two correctness fixes).

### Issue 1: lexical companion symlinks survive reboot/restore

**Root cause**: `AttachmentEntry.host_path` is stored as the resolved canonical path (via `_norm_dir` → `resolve()`). After a reboot, `_restore_saved_vm_attachments` only had the resolved path, so it could not recreate companion guest symlinks for attachments originally made through a host symlink.

**Fix**: Added `host_lexical_path: str = ''` to `AttachmentEntry` in `aivm/store.py`. This field is only populated when the host source was a symlink (lexical ≠ resolved). It is omitted from the serialized TOML when empty, so existing store files load cleanly with the default empty string (backward compat).

`_record_attachment` in `aivm/cli/vm.py` now computes `host_lexical_path = str(host_src.expanduser().absolute())` when it differs from `str(host_src.resolve())` and passes it to `upsert_attachment`.

`_restore_saved_vm_attachments` now loads a lexical-path map `{source_dir → host_lexical_path}` from the store at the start of the function. In both the shared and shared-root restore paths, it constructs `_restore_src = Path(lexical)` when available, falling back to `Path(aligned.source_dir)` for non-symlink attachments. This `_restore_src` is passed to `_apply_guest_derived_symlinks` and `_ensure_attachment_available_in_guest`.

### Issue 2: explicit custom `guest_dst` suppresses resolved-path mirror

**Root cause**: In `_apply_guest_derived_symlinks`, step 3 (mirror-home for resolved path) unconditionally passed `is_default_dst=True` to `_compute_mirror_home_symlink`, so a user-specified `--guest-dst` did not suppress the resolved-path mirror.

**Fix**: Changed `if lexical is not None:` to `if lexical is not None and is_default_dst:`. The `is_default_dst` value is already computed in step 2 from `guest_dst == _default_primary_guest_dst(host_src)`. The resolved-path mirror now only runs when the attachment used the default computed destination.

### Tests added (6 new)

- `test_record_attachment_persists_lexical_path_for_symlink`: lexical path stored for symlink host_src
- `test_record_attachment_no_lexical_path_for_non_symlink`: empty string for non-symlink host_src
- `test_store_backward_compat_missing_lexical_path`: old TOML without `host_lexical_path` loads with default `''`
- `test_restore_uses_lexical_path_for_companion_symlink`: restore flow passes lexical `host_src` to `_apply_guest_derived_symlinks`
- `test_restore_non_symlink_attachment_unchanged`: non-symlink restore path still uses `source_dir`
- `test_apply_guest_derived_symlinks_custom_dst_suppresses_all_mirrors`: no mirror-home created when explicit guest_dst, for both lexical and resolved paths

Full suite: 264 passed, 3 skipped.

## 2026-03-31 19:10:00 +0000

Session completed Pass 3 of the attachment path policy / mirror-symlink feature.

### What was done

**`_apply_guest_derived_symlinks` helper** (`aivm/cli/vm.py`): New module-level function that consolidates all post-attachment guest-side symlink creation. It handles three cases in sequence: (1) companion symlink at the lexical host path when host_src is a symlink, (2) mirror-home symlink for the lexical host path when `mirror_home=True`, and (3) mirror-home symlink for the *resolved* host path independently when host_src is a symlink — so both `~/link` and `~/real` under the guest home point to the primary guest_dst when either is under the host home.

**Inline block replacement**: The repeated 12-line companion+mirror block that existed in `_ensure_attachment_available_in_guest` and the git branch of `_prepare_attached_session` was replaced with single calls to `_apply_guest_derived_symlinks`. No behavioral change in those paths; this is pure refactoring to share the new dual-path logic.

**`_restore_saved_vm_attachments` (`aivm/cli/vm.py`)**: Added `mirror_home: bool = False` parameter. Shared-root restore path now passes `mirror_home` through to `_ensure_attachment_available_in_guest`. Shared restore path now calls `_apply_guest_derived_symlinks` after `ensure_share_mounted` succeeds, before `_record_attachment`. Both `_restore_saved_vm_attachments` call sites in `_prepare_attached_session` updated to pass `mirror_home`.

### Dual-path mirror semantics

When `host_src` is a symlink on the host:
- Primary guest destination = resolved real path (unchanged)
- Companion symlink at lexical host path on the guest → resolved guest_dst
- Mirror-home for lexical: if `~/link` is under host home, create `~guest/link` → resolved guest_dst
- Mirror-home for resolved: if `~/real` is under host home, create `~guest/real` → resolved guest_dst

The two mirrors are computed independently via `_compute_mirror_home_symlink` with separate `host_src` inputs (lexical for one, `host_src.resolve()` for the other). A deduplication guard prevents creating the same symlink path twice if they happen to compute identically.

### Tests

Five new tests: `test_apply_guest_derived_symlinks_companion_only`, `test_apply_guest_derived_symlinks_dual_mirror_for_symlink_host`, `test_apply_guest_derived_symlinks_no_dup_mirror_when_same`, `test_restore_shared_attachment_applies_guest_derived_symlinks`, `test_restore_shared_root_attachment_passes_mirror_home`. Full suite: 258 passed, 3 skipped (up from 242 + 16 Pass 2 tests = 258 total).

---

## 2026-03-31 17:43:06 +0000

Session focused on attachment path policy unification and the new mirror-symlink feature (spec was provided as a detailed prompt).

### What was done

Four files changed: `aivm/config.py`, `aivm/store.py`, `aivm/vm/share.py`, `aivm/cli/vm.py`, plus test updates in `tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py`.

**Tag generation** (`aivm/vm/share.py`): `_auto_share_tag_for_path` now always includes a stable 8-hex-char hash of the resolved path in every generated tag (`hostcode-<name>-<hash>`). Previously the hash was only added on collision. This is a quiet but important correctness fix — two directories with the same basename used to silently get the same tag until one was detected as a conflict at attach time.

**Unified default guest destination** (`aivm/cli/vm.py`): Removed the git-mode special case that defaulted the guest destination to `/home/<user>/...` relative. All modes now default to the lexical absolute host path (`expanduser().absolute()`). The old auto-migration logic (which tried to retroactively rewrite saved `guest_dst` values that matched the host path to the guest-home-relative form) was also removed. Existing saved records are preserved as-is. This is a breaking behavioral change for any new git attachments, but the right call: users who attach `/home/joncrall/code/repo` should find it at `/home/joncrall/code/repo` in the guest, not at a rewritten path under `/home/agent/`.

**Host symlink handling**: Added `_default_primary_guest_dst` and `_host_symlink_lexical_path` helpers. If the host source is itself a symlink, the primary guest destination becomes the resolved real path, and a companion symlink is created on the guest at the lexical path. The safety rules for companion symlinks (`_ensure_guest_symlink`) cover: no-op if already correct, replace empty dir, warn-and-skip for non-empty dir / regular file / wrong-target symlink.

**Mirror-home** (`behavior.mirror_shared_home_folders`): New `BehaviorConfig` flag (default false). When enabled and the host path is under the host home and the guest home differs, `_ensure_attachment_available_in_guest` creates a symlink under the guest home mirroring the relative path. The flag is threaded from the store into `VMAttachCLI.main` and `_prepare_attached_session`.

**Git exact-path support** (`_ensure_guest_git_repo`): Updated the shell script to use `sudo -n mkdir -p <parent>` with a fallback `sudo -n chown` on the leaf when `mkdir -p <root>` fails unprivileged. This allows git-mode to work when the destination is outside the guest home (e.g. `/home/joncrall/code/repo` on the guest).

### Tradeoffs and risks

The biggest behavioral change is the git-mode default destination. Any new git attachment that previously would have gone to `/home/agent/code/repo` will now go to `/home/joncrall/code/repo` (matching the host). This is intentional but could surprise users who relied on the old behavior for a path that required a writable guest home. The spec explicitly called for this change and the old auto-migration was already fragile.

The `VMAttachCLI.main` change from `Path(...).resolve()` to `Path(...).expanduser().absolute()` for `host_src` is necessary for symlink detection to work, but means any downstream code that assumed `host_src` was always fully resolved may see a non-resolved path. Audited all uses in that function — they all pass through `_resolve_attachment` which calls `host_src.resolve()` internally for `source_dir`, so this is safe.

The `_ensure_guest_symlink` helper uses `sudo -n mkdir -p` for the symlink parent on the guest. This is fine for typical aivm setups where the guest user has passwordless sudo, but could silently fail or warn if sudo isn't configured. The function logs a warning on unexpected exit codes but doesn't raise.

### Confidence

High confidence on the core path-unification and tag changes — they're simple and well-tested. Medium confidence on the symlink companion and mirror-home paths since they involve SSH guest-side shell scripts that are harder to integration-test without a live VM. The unit tests cover the logic paths but not actual SSH execution.

### Tests

Two tests were updated to reflect the new behavior (git default path, no migration). 21 new tests were added covering: default guest dst helpers, tag hash properties, guest symlink safety rules, mirror-home path computation, and the mirror integration through `_ensure_attachment_available_in_guest`. Full suite: 242 passed, 3 skipped.

---

## 2026-03-28 00:15:00 +0000

Session focused on three areas: changelog maintenance, removing dead backward-compatibility code, and improving log attribution in `CommandManager`.

### Changelog

Added a v0.4.0 entry to `CHANGELOG.md` covering the major changes since v0.3.0: the `CommandManager` module, drift detection (`aivm/vm/drift.py`), status enhancements, the formal attachment model (`AttachmentMode`/`AttachmentAccess`/`ResolvedAttachment`), and the removal of legacy `run_cmd`/`CmdResult`/sudo-intent from `aivm/util.py`. User subsequently released v0.3.0 and v0.4.0, and created a v0.4.1 unreleased section.

### Backward-compatibility alias cleanup

Removed the only backward-compat alias in the codebase: `saved_attachment_drift_report = saved_vm_drift_report` in `aivm/vm/drift.py`. It had zero callers. Since the project has no public Python API (CLI only), these aliases serve no purpose.

### CommandManager log attribution refactor

The original problem: log lines from `CommandManager` methods like `_render_plan_preview` showed `aivm.commands:_render_plan_preview:1028` as the source frame, which is unhelpful to operators. The real question is "which caller triggered this plan?"

**First attempt (reverted):** Added `_caller_log(submitted_by)` which parsed the `capture_submitter()` provenance string (`module:function:lineno`) and used `log.patch()` to override loguru's frame fields. User rejected this as fragile — it relied on string parsing and on the plan/spec capturing a submitter at submit-time for replay at log-time. The `capture_submitter()` method itself was doing frame-walking via `inspect.currentframe()` to find the first non-internal caller.

**Final approach:** Replaced the entire `capture_submitter`/`submitted_by` mechanism with `_stacklevel` parameter threading. Each internal method accepts `_stacklevel` and increments it by 1 when calling deeper methods, so `log.opt(depth=_stacklevel)` naturally points at the real caller frame. Entry points seed the initial value: `PlanScope.__exit__` passes `_stacklevel=2`, `run()` passes `_stacklevel=2` into `submit()`, etc. Removed `capture_submitter()`, `_caller_log()`, and the `submitted_by` field from both `CommandSpec` and `CommandPlan`.

This is mechanically straightforward and the depth count is always exact — no string parsing, no frame-walking at submit time, and the provenance is derived from the actual call stack at log time rather than reconstructed.

**Removed fields/methods:**
- `CommandSpec.submitted_by`
- `CommandPlan.submitted_by`
- `CommandManager.capture_submitter()`
- `CommandManager._caller_log()`
- `import inspect` (no longer needed)

**Methods that gained `_stacklevel`:** `submit`, `run`, `flush`, `flush_through`, `finish_plan`, `_approve_plan_if_needed`, `_render_plan_preview`, `_render_plan_full_commands`, `_flush_plan`, `_flush_loose_commands`, `_execute_one`, `_confirm_loose_sudo_command`, and `CommandHandle.result`.

### Docs update

Updated `docs/source/design.rst` and `docs/source/workflows.rst` to remove stale references to the `run_cmd` compatibility shim and "migration continues" language. The migration to `CommandManager` is complete — no shim exists.

Tradeoffs and what might break: the `_stacklevel` approach is precise but requires discipline — if someone adds an intermediate call in the chain without threading `_stacklevel + 1`, the frame attribution will be off by one. This is a reasonable tradeoff: the failure mode is merely a wrong log frame (cosmetic), not incorrect behavior, and it's the standard pattern used by Python's own `warnings.warn(stacklevel=)`.

Uncertainties: the `_stacklevel` defaults assume the public methods (`submit`, `run`, `flush`, `flush_through`) are called directly from user code. If they're called from other internal helpers in the future, those helpers would need to thread `_stacklevel` too. The default of 1 means "direct caller is user code" which is correct for all current call sites.
