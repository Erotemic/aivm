Session focused on stabilizing `aivm code .` after reboot and stale VM/config state. The main decision was to prioritize robustness for bad runtime state (stale libvirt definitions, missing sudo ticket, broken probe gating) without adding broader legacy-config compatibility work. Key fixes landed across `aivm/cli/_common.py`, `aivm/cli/vm.py`, `aivm/vm/lifecycle.py`, and `aivm/util.py`: warming sudo credentials after privileged confirmation, reordering VM start/create flow to avoid unnecessary image fetch on existing stopped VMs, detecting stale virtiofs-source startup errors and forcing recreate path, hardening domain teardown before recreate (multiple undefine strategies + verify gone), improving logging caller attribution via Loguru depth, and improving wait-for-IP UX with periodic progress diagnostics and explicit “may be booting vs hung” messaging.

The dominant challenge was layered failure modes that looked similar at CLI level but had different root causes (sudo ticket expiration, stale share path in domain XML, domain not actually undefined, guest booting to initramfs, firewall state inconclusive without sudo, and no DHCP/`domifaddr` visibility while VM reported running). We added recovery logic where safe, but there is still uncertainty about guest-network bring-up reliability under strict firewall policy and first-boot cloud-init timing. To reduce boot stalls, cloud-init generation now constrains datasource to NoCloud and writes seed `network-config` with optional DHCP interfaces; wait-online services are also masked. Tradeoff: this speeds boot and avoids external metadata probing, but may hide networking issues that would otherwise fail loudly; if interface naming differs unexpectedly, optional netplan entries may still not match. Confident: command-level regressions are low-risk and compile checks passed for touched modules. Not yet confident: end-to-end boot/network readiness across host environments and all libvirt/network backend variations.

Potential breakpoints to watch: recreate path storage semantics (`--remove-all-storage`), VM guest identity/cache mismatch after forced recreate, and firewall behavior when probes run unprivileged first then privileged fallback. Suggested next validation: full clean destroy/recreate cycle, capture `aivm code . -vvv --yes` timing before/after, and verify guest obtains DHCP lease + SSH readiness without manual VM-manager intervention.

Reflection/state of mind: this session felt like peeling an onion of interacting host/guest state bugs where each fix exposed the next bottleneck. I’m confident the debugging direction is now coherent (logs are more attributable, wait states are more visible, and bad/stale VM definitions are handled more explicitly), but I’m not fully confident the current behavior is stable across clean-room boots and different host libvirt setups yet. The work shifted from “single bug fix” to “resilience pass,” and I intentionally chose pragmatic guardrails over deep architectural refactors to keep momentum and reduce blast radius.

Uncertainties/risks: guest boot/network timing is still the biggest unknown, especially with strict firewall settings and virtualization/network stack variance; cloud-init + wait-online behavior can differ by image version and renderer. Recreate flows now do stronger teardown checks, but storage lifecycle edge-cases (NVRAM/snapshots/leftover disks) could still surprise users. Probe-driven branching may still miss rare mixed states (e.g., stale cached IP combined with partial guest boot).

Tradeoffs and what might break: adding aggressive self-healing/recreate behavior improves recovery from stale configs but can hide root causes and may surprise users who expected strictly non-destructive correction paths. For networking, forcing NoCloud and optional DHCP reduces boot blocking but may allow system boot to proceed with unresolved network, moving failure later in workflow instead of during early boot. Logging depth changes rely on formatter conventions; if formatter changes, caller attribution quality could regress.

What I am confident about: the command-path correctness around sudo prompting/ticketing and start-vs-create ordering is materially better than before; stale virtiofs path detection is now explicit; and wait-for-IP UX is improved with status-oriented feedback instead of silent loops. Syntax checks passed for all touched modules, and the code paths now surface clearer diagnostics to guide the next iteration.

## 2026-02-26 12:59:09 -0500

State of mind / reflection: confidence increased materially after host-side packet capture confirmed a concrete network-path root cause (guest DHCP discover sent, no offer returned). The work shifted from uncertain guest-side debugging to a specific host firewall rule correction, which reduced ambiguity and made the system behavior understandable again.

What happened: patched firewall generation in `aivm/firewall.py` so DHCP on the VM bridge is accepted regardless of destination IP (broadcast discover to `255.255.255.255` was previously dropped by the bridge input rule). User reported successful access into the new VM after applying changes.

Uncertainties / risks: there may still be edge conditions around guest init timing, cloud-init final stage failures, or libvirt lease visibility lag. MAC churn across recreate cycles can still confuse expectations when correlating static reservations/logs, though it does not explain this specific DHCP drop once firewall is corrected.

Tradeoffs: firewall remains intentionally strict for guest->host bridge traffic; widening DHCP allowance was scoped narrowly to bridge ingress UDP ports 67/68 to preserve isolation intent while restoring baseline network boot behavior.

What might break: if environments rely on custom DHCP relay behavior or non-standard bridge/interface wiring, the current assumption that DHCP should always be accepted on bridge ingress could be too permissive or insufficiently specific.

What I am confident about: root cause for the observed timeout loop in this session was the firewall DHCP destination constraint; fix is targeted, low-risk, and aligned with observed packet traces.

## 2026-02-26 13:41:22 -0500

Reflection/state of mind: this refactor felt like the right time to simplify aggressively because the old dual-model (registry + per-VM files + optional local metadata) was creating confusion in code paths and UX. I’m more confident in maintainability now because the state model is singular and explicit, but I’m also aware this was a large conceptual rename and therefore carries integration risk in edge CLI flows not covered by tests.

What changed at a high level: removed the old registry concept and renamed it to a single config store model, centered on `~/.config/aivm/config.toml` with `[[vms]]` and `[[attachments]]`. Reworked CLI resolution and persistence (`aivm/cli/_common.py`, `aivm/cli/config.py`, `aivm/cli/vm.py`, `aivm/cli/main.py`, `aivm/status.py`) to use store APIs only. Deleted `aivm/registry.py`, introduced `aivm/store.py`, replaced registry test with store test (`tests/test_store.py`), and updated existing CLI dry-run tests to build store files directly.

Uncertainties/risks: migration for existing users is manual and currently external (by design), so stale legacy files in real environments may cause user confusion until migrated. There is still potential for semantic drift where “config store path” and “resolved VM selection” behavior may surprise users in ambiguous multi-VM cases. Help text and docs were updated, but there may be remaining narrative mismatches outside core README.

Tradeoffs and what might break: this intentionally drops backward compatibility and local metadata support, reducing complexity but breaking old workflows that relied on `.aivm.toml` or `.aivm-dir.toml`. The compose-like embedded VM config in TOML triple-quoted strings optimizes simplicity and reuse of existing config serializer, but is not as elegant as fully normalized nested TOML structures and may be harder to hand-edit carefully.

What I am confident about: core code compiles, imports cleanly, and tests pass (`36 passed`). CLI smoke checks for config init/path/list with custom `--config` store path are working. The project is now aligned with a single-source-of-truth state model, which should make future iteration on VM selection and attachment UX much cleaner.

## 2026-02-26 20:33:15 +0000

Worked on tightening confirmation boundaries around user-owned files by gating `~/.ssh/config` edits in the `aivm vm code` path behind an interactive prompt unless `--yes` is supplied. Added a dedicated helper (`_confirm_external_file_update`) in `aivm/cli/_common.py`, wired it into `_upsert_ssh_config_entry` in `aivm/cli/vm.py`, and adjusted shared `--yes` help text to reflect broader confirmation semantics.

State of mind / reflection: this was a small but important policy-consistency change; I wanted the behavior to mirror the existing sudo confirmation UX without over-coupling file-edit confirmation to privileged-operation logic. The clearest tradeoff was adding one more interactive checkpoint for `vm code` users who are not using `--yes`, but that aligns with explicit-consent expectations for modifying unmanaged files.

Uncertainties / risks: there may be other code paths (now or later) that touch user-owned files and should also use the same helper; those would need a follow-up audit. Behavior in non-interactive environments now intentionally fails fast unless `--yes` is set, which is correct for safety but could surprise scripts that relied on implicit writes.

What might break: workflows that call `aivm vm code` in non-interactive sessions without `--yes` will now error before writing SSH config. Confident this is intended behavior and matches the safety contract. Added targeted unit tests in `tests/test_cli_helpers.py` for `--yes` bypass, non-interactive refusal, and explicit abort response.

## 2026-02-27 17:20:06 +0000

Worked on a follow-up to SSH-config confirmation flow: avoid asking for external-file update permission when `~/.ssh/config` does not need to change. Updated `_upsert_ssh_config_entry` in `aivm/cli/vm.py` to read and compute the post-upsert content first, return early when unchanged, and only invoke `_confirm_external_file_update` immediately before an actual write.

State of mind / reflection: this was a precision fix motivated by friction in real usage. The previous behavior was safety-correct but ergonomically noisy because it treated idempotent runs as mutating operations. The revised order keeps the same safety guarantee for writes while honoring the principle of skipping unnecessary privileged/consent flows when we can infer no-op behavior.

Uncertainties / risks: newline normalization and block-matching regex semantics are still the critical edge points; if a user has hand-edited spacing inside the managed block, we still classify that as a write-needed update, which is expected but could trigger prompt surprise. Also, if the file does not exist, this remains a write path and still requires confirmation unless `--yes` is set.

Tradeoffs and what might break: preserving prompt-on-write means non-interactive automation without `--yes` still fails for true updates, by design. The main tradeoff is slightly more logic in the upsert path to avoid false-positive prompts. Added regression coverage in `tests/test_cli_helpers.py` (`test_upsert_ssh_config_no_confirm_when_unchanged`) to lock behavior for non-interactive, unchanged re-upsert.

Validation: `pytest -q tests/test_cli_helpers.py` passed (8 tests).

## 2026-02-27 17:26:07 +0000

Worked on restoring colored Loguru output for interactive CLI runs. The issue was self-inflicted in `aivm/cli/main.py`: `_setup_logging` forced `colorize=False`, which disabled level/message colors unconditionally even in a terminal. I changed setup to derive `colorize` from runtime conditions (`sys.stderr.isatty()` and `NO_COLOR` not set), and updated the log format to wrap level/message in `<level>...</level>` markup so color application is explicit.

State of mind / reflection: this was a straightforward quality-of-life fix, but it highlighted an important ergonomics-vs-portability balance. I wanted to preserve clean redirected output while making interactive diagnostics visually scannable again. Choosing auto-color with `NO_COLOR` compliance felt like the most pragmatic middle ground with minimal behavioral surprise.

Uncertainties / risks: terminal/color behavior can still vary with host environment variables (`NO_COLOR`, `TERM`) and PTY handling. In this environment `NO_COLOR=1`, so color stays disabled by design; users expecting color in such environments will need to unset that variable.

Tradeoffs and what might break: adding `<level>` markup scopes coloring to level and message fields; if users parse stderr logs with strict plain-text expectations in TTY mode, ANSI codes may now appear where they previously did not. Redirected/non-TTY output remains uncolored.

What I am confident about: syntax checks passed via `python -m py_compile aivm/*.py aivm/cli/*.py aivm/vm/*.py`, and logging setup now aligns with typical terminal-color conventions without forcing color into non-interactive sinks.

## 2026-02-27 17:30:18 +0000

Adjusted the logging formatter in `aivm/cli/main.py` to more closely match Loguru’s default color scheme after feedback. Kept the existing field layout (time, level, caller, message) but switched color tags to default-style palette: green timestamp, level-colored severity/message, and cyan caller components.

State of mind / reflection: this was a fast refinement to align visual expectations rather than functional behavior. The previous fix restored conditional coloring, but the palette emphasized only level/message; this update makes output feel immediately familiar to users accustomed to stock Loguru defaults.

Uncertainties / risks: exact appearance still depends on terminal theme capabilities and environment flags like `NO_COLOR`; if that variable is present, colors remain intentionally disabled.

Tradeoffs and what might break: no behavior change to verbosity/routing, only formatter styling. Any tooling that expects plain uncolored text in TTY mode may still need `NO_COLOR=1`.

What I am confident about: compile checks still pass and formatter now tracks Loguru’s default visual language more closely while preserving caller detail.

## 2026-02-27 17:59:28 +0000

Implemented runtime environment detection in status reporting so users can quickly see whether `aivm` is running on a host system or inside a virtualized guest. Added `probe_runtime_environment()` in `aivm/status.py` with layered detection: `systemd-detect-virt` when available, fallback to `/proc/cpuinfo` hypervisor flag, and DMI product-name heuristics before yielding unknown. Wired this into both scoped and global status outputs, with extra diagnostics in `--detail` mode.

State of mind / reflection: this was intentionally narrow and low-risk to improve observability before building nested-VM tooling. I focused on best-effort signals that are usually available without elevated privileges, while avoiding hard failures when host capabilities differ.

Uncertainties / risks: virtualization detection is heuristic and environment-dependent; some bare-metal systems with unusual firmware strings or containerized contexts may remain “unknown” or occasionally misclassified. Current logic optimizes for non-invasive checks rather than exhaustive platform-specific detection.

Tradeoffs and what might break: status output gains one additional line (`Runtime environment`), which may affect consumers parsing status text verbatim. I kept existing progress-check accounting unchanged to avoid changing completion ratios based on heuristic detection.

What I am confident about: targeted tests cover guest/host/unknown branches and global status wiring (`tests/test_status_runtime.py`), and related status helper tests still pass. Compile checks pass for touched modules.

## 2026-02-27 20:36:23 +0000

Adjusted `aivm help plan` command rendering so it only includes `--config <path>` when using a non-default config-store path. Kept the plan header line showing the resolved config path for visibility, but removed repeated `--config` noise from suggested commands when the path is the default store.

State of mind / reflection: this was a small UX polish with high signal-to-noise value. The existing output was technically correct but overly verbose in the common case; this change makes the quick-copy workflow cleaner without hiding which config is active.

Uncertainties / risks: command-string assertions can be sensitive to future formatting changes in the plan template. I added focused tests to lock intended behavior for default vs custom config paths.

Tradeoffs and what might break: users who relied on always seeing explicit `--config` in plan commands may need to infer the default path from the header line. Non-default paths remain explicit in every command, preserving safety for multi-config workflows.

What I am confident about: helper tests now cover both branches (`tests/test_cli_helpers.py`) and pass locally, and compile checks remain clean.

## 2026-02-27 20:45:27 +0000

Addressed a sudo UX bug affecting VM-side workflows: `_confirm_sudo_block` would proactively run `sudo -v` even when `--yes` was supplied, which could trigger an unnecessary password prompt in environments where `sudo -v` policy differs from command-level sudo usage. Updated `aivm/cli/_common.py` so `--yes` bypasses interactive confirmation *and* skips sudo-ticket warmup.

State of mind / reflection: this was a good reminder that convenience preflight checks can become correctness bugs when they are stricter than the real execution path. The right behavior for `--yes` is “do not block on interactive sudo validation”; command execution can still fail naturally where privileges are truly unavailable.

Uncertainties / risks: skipping `sudo -v` under `--yes` means first privileged command failure may now happen deeper in the command path rather than upfront. That is acceptable and more consistent with non-interactive semantics.

Tradeoffs and what might break: users who liked eager sudo-cache warming with `--yes` lose that behavior; interactive non-`--yes` flow still keeps existing confirmation + `sudo -v` warmup.

What I am confident about: added regression coverage in `tests/test_cli_helpers.py` (`test_confirm_sudo_block_yes_skips_sudo_validate`) and helper test suite passes.

## 2026-02-27 20:50:18 +0000

Refined sudo confirmation behavior to better support VM environments with passwordless sudo. Added `_has_passwordless_sudo()` in `aivm/cli/_common.py` and integrated it into `_confirm_sudo_block()`: before any interactive `sudo -v` warmup, the code now probes `sudo -n true`; if that succeeds, it marks sudo as validated and skips `sudo -v` entirely.

State of mind / reflection: this adjustment better aligns policy intent (explicit confirmation unless `--yes`) with practical execution realities in nested/guest contexts where sudo is available non-interactively. The previous eager `sudo -v` check could be stricter than actual command execution and therefore blocked valid workflows.

Uncertainties / risks: `sudo -n true` behavior can vary under custom sudoers policy; in rare setups it may fail despite other commands succeeding with different policy tags. Current fallback still uses the previous `sudo -v` prompt path after explicit confirmation.

Tradeoffs and what might break: this adds one extra lightweight sudo probe call (`sudo -n true`) per process until cached validation is set. That slight overhead is intentional to avoid unnecessary password prompts.

What I am confident about: helper tests now cover both `--yes` and non-`--yes` passwordless-sudo branches and pass (`tests/test_cli_helpers.py`). Compile checks remain clean.

## 2026-02-27 20:54:10 +0000

Adjusted host dependency installation command execution to stream output for long-running operations. In `aivm/host.py`, switched `run_cmd(..., capture=True)` to `capture=False` for `apt-get update`, `apt-get install`, and the follow-up `systemctl enable --now libvirtd` call so users can observe progress and troubleshoot stalls in real time.

State of mind / reflection: this was an operator-visibility improvement with low technical risk and high usability payoff. Silent capture is fine for short probes, but long installs should be transparent by default.

Uncertainties / risks: uncaptured output is noisier, but this command is explicitly operational and long-running, so verbosity is expected. Error handling semantics remain unchanged.

Tradeoffs and what might break: tests that assumed only command ordering (and ignored kwargs) needed a slight update to assert capture behavior explicitly.

What I am confident about: host tests now validate the non-capturing behavior for apt calls, helper tests still pass, and compile checks are clean.

## 2026-02-27 20:58:51 +0000

Added an opt-in end-to-end nested smoke test in `tests/test_e2e_nested.py` that runs the real CLI via `python -m aivm` against an isolated temporary config store. The flow provisions unique VM/network names, creates host network, brings VM up, waits for IP, checks status, and performs best-effort cleanup (VM destroy + network destroy) in `finally`.

State of mind / reflection: I kept this intentionally pragmatic and operationally safe. E2E coverage is valuable here, but default test runs should stay fast and deterministic, so the test is guarded behind `AIVM_E2E=1` and preflight checks for SSH key availability + passwordless sudo.

Uncertainties / risks: this test depends on host/libvirt state, networking availability, and image cache/download behavior, so runtime and reliability will vary by environment. It is a smoke test, not a full conformance suite.

Tradeoffs and what might break: assertions are intentionally lightweight (`vm ip`/`cached vm ip`, `vm state`) to reduce false negatives across minor output changes; this sacrifices strictness in exchange for portability.

What I am confident about: default CI/local test runs are unaffected (test skips unless explicitly enabled), targeted test invocation works, and syntax checks pass.

## 2026-02-27 21:02:12 +0000

Refined the opt-in nested E2E smoke test to remove dependency on user-global SSH identities. `tests/test_e2e_nested.py` now generates a temporary ed25519 keypair with `ssh-keygen`, writes an isolated `~/.ssh/config` under a temp HOME, and runs all `python -m aivm` subprocesses with that HOME in env. VM config paths (`ssh_identity_file`, `ssh_pubkey_path`) now point to these ephemeral files.

State of mind / reflection: this change makes the E2E path much more reproducible and safer for local developer environments by avoiding hidden reliance on personal `~/.ssh` state. The test setup is now explicit and self-contained.

Uncertainties / risks: environments lacking `ssh-keygen` will skip this E2E path; that is acceptable for an opt-in integration test. Runtime variability from libvirt/network/image operations remains unchanged.

Tradeoffs and what might break: added setup work per run (small keygen overhead) in exchange for deterministic SSH material provisioning.

What I am confident about: default runs still skip unless `AIVM_E2E=1`, and syntax/targeted test checks pass with the new setup.

## 2026-02-27 21:05:56 +0000

Updated nested E2E CLI runner to stream live subprocess output while still capturing it for assertions and failure diagnostics. In `tests/test_e2e_nested.py`, replaced `subprocess.run(..., capture_output=True)` with a `Popen` + line-by-line tee loop (`stderr` merged into `stdout`) so `pytest -s` shows command progress in real time.

State of mind / reflection: this was important observability plumbing for long-running integration steps. Silent capture made failures expensive to debug because the only signal appeared after timeout/error. Live tee output lowers debugging latency significantly.

Uncertainties / risks: merged stderr/stdout sacrifices channel separation, but preserves chronological visibility which is more valuable for this smoke test.

Tradeoffs and what might break: output volume is larger when running with `-s`, by design. The runner still retains captured output for final assertions and failure messages.

What I am confident about: the test module still skips cleanly by default, syntax checks pass, and the new runner behavior is aligned with interactive debugging needs.

## 2026-02-27 21:10:10 +0000

Addressed nested E2E failure caused by missing UEFI firmware in the test environment and reduced smoke-test VM footprint. In `aivm/vm/lifecycle.py`, `create_or_start_vm()` now catches `virt-install` failures that specifically indicate missing x86_64 UEFI firmware and retries VM creation once without the `--boot uefi` arguments. Added a unit regression test in `tests/test_vm_helpers.py` to lock this fallback path.

Also updated `tests/test_e2e_nested.py` to use lower resource settings for smoke runs (`1 vCPU`, `2048 MB RAM`, `16 GB disk`) to better fit nested test environments.

State of mind / reflection: this is a pragmatic resilience improvement. Strict UEFI-only boot is ideal where available, but failing hard on hosts without OVMF blocks otherwise-valid smoke coverage. A targeted retry on one known error keeps behavior predictable while improving portability.

Uncertainties / risks: non-UEFI fallback may behave differently for some guest images/boot paths, though Ubuntu cloud images generally support legacy boot in common libvirt setups. Fallback is intentionally narrow to avoid masking unrelated `virt-install` errors.

Tradeoffs and what might break: hosts expecting UEFI-specific behavior (secure boot assumptions, firmware-variable workflows) will now silently run BIOS fallback when UEFI binaries are absent; this is primarily relevant in constrained environments and is logged as a warning.

What I am confident about: regression test covers the fallback trigger and command retry shape; targeted test suite and compile checks pass.

## 2026-02-27 21:14:51 +0000

Changed nested E2E image strategy to default to a user-level shared cache instead of independent per-run network download. In `tests/test_e2e_nested.py`, added `_ensure_user_cached_image()` and wiring so, unless `AIVM_E2E_INDEPENDENT_IMAGE=1`, the test populates/uses `~/.cache/aivm/e2e/noble-base.img` (or `AIVM_E2E_SHARED_IMAGE`) and points VM image URL to `file://...`.

State of mind / reflection: this aligns test cost with what we actually care about validating. Downloading cloud images repeatedly is noise for this smoke test and slows iteration without improving confidence in VM lifecycle logic.

Uncertainties / risks: the per-run VM image path still causes a local file copy from the shared cache (via existing fetch logic) rather than direct in-place reuse; this keeps behavior stable but does not fully eliminate I/O overhead.

Tradeoffs and what might break: default behavior now depends on local curl/file URL handling and a persistent user cache path. Independent mode remains available via env flag for clean-room testing.

What I am confident about: default test-run behavior remains opt-in and skip-safe, and syntax/targeted test checks pass after this change.

## 2026-02-27 21:38:32 +0000

Implemented a more interactive `aivm config init` flow to make default choices explicit before persisting config. Added a new `--defaults` flag to `config init` and changed behavior so, unless `--yes` or `--defaults` is supplied, init now prints a detailed detected-default summary and asks user confirmation (`[Y/e/n]`), with an edit path to adjust key fields inline before save.

State of mind / reflection: this change improves user trust and visibility without overcomplicating the first-run path. The main goal was making implicit auto-detection decisions visible and user-approved by default in interactive sessions.

Uncertainties / risks: inline edit prompts currently cover high-impact fields but are still text-based and minimal; users can still use `config edit` for full control after init. Prompt wording/output can drift over time and may require upkeep in tests.

Tradeoffs and what might break: non-interactive `config init` now errors unless `--yes` or `--defaults` is provided. This is intentional for explicitness but could affect unattended scripts that previously relied on implicit defaults.

What I am confident about: added targeted tests for non-interactive enforcement, `--defaults` bypass, and interactive summary confirmation (`tests/test_cli_config_init.py`), and existing CLI helper/dry-run tests still pass.

## 2026-02-27 21:41:39 +0000

Added explicit SSH-key setup warnings to `aivm config init` when detected identity/public key paths are missing on disk. The init flow now prints actionable guidance with a concrete `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 ...` command and a follow-up `aivm config init --force` reminder. Warning appears during interactive review and also in non-interactive `--yes/--defaults` paths.

State of mind / reflection: this is a small but high-value usability guardrail. Missing SSH keys are a common first-run blocker; surfacing the fix at init time is better than deferring to later SSH/provision failures.

Uncertainties / risks: warning is currently tied to detected file existence; users with atypical key management (hardware tokens, agent-only keys, non-file identities) may see a warning they can safely ignore.

Tradeoffs and what might break: init output is slightly noisier, intentionally. The warning is advisory only and does not block config creation.

What I am confident about: added test coverage for both interactive and defaults flows (`tests/test_cli_config_init.py`) and related CLI tests pass.

## 2026-02-27 21:42:49 +0000

Adjusted `aivm config init` to stop auto-populating `share.host_src` with the current working directory. The command still uses host/network/SSH auto-detection defaults, but now explicitly clears share source during init so host-folder exposure only occurs through explicit attach/code workflows.

State of mind / reflection: this aligns init semantics with least-surprise and least-exposure principles. Auto-sharing cwd at init was convenient but easy to misinterpret as implicit permission/attachment state.

Uncertainties / risks: users accustomed to previous behavior may need one extra explicit attach/code step before first use. This is a UX tradeoff in favor of safety and intentionality.

Tradeoffs and what might break: tests and summary output expectations needed updates because `share.host_src` now defaults to empty in init-created configs.

What I am confident about: targeted CLI init/helper/dryrun tests pass with assertions covering empty `share.host_src` persistence and interactive summary display.

## 2026-02-27 21:43:45 +0000

Refined SSH-key advisory behavior in `aivm config init`: missing-key guidance now emits through Loguru (`log.warning(...)`) in addition to human-readable CLI output, and removed the previous “re-run with --force” suggestion. The warning is now explicitly advisory-only messaging and does not imply required follow-up init reruns.

State of mind / reflection: this keeps diagnostic signal visible in both structured logs and terminal UX while avoiding prescriptive/incorrect remediation steps. The intent is to inform, not alter control flow.

Uncertainties / risks: duplicate visibility (stdout + log warning) is intentional, but may feel noisy at higher verbosity levels; acceptable for setup-time advisories.

Tradeoffs and what might break: tests needed minor updates to validate log-warning emission instead of older textual guidance.

What I am confident about: targeted config-init tests pass and include coverage that a log warning is produced when key files are missing.

## 2026-02-27 21:46:06 +0000

Updated SSH identity auto-detection to explicitly inspect `~/.ssh/config` first before falling back to existing `ssh -G` and key-file heuristics. Added `_detect_identity_from_ssh_config()` in `aivm/detect.py` that parses `Host` + `IdentityFile` directives (including `Host *` defaults) and resolves `%d`/`~` paths prior to existence checks.

State of mind / reflection: this change addresses a real user expectation mismatch. If a default `IdentityFile` is intentionally set in SSH config, aivm should honor it before choosing conventional key filenames.

Uncertainties / risks: parser intentionally handles common cases and does not yet implement full OpenSSH config semantics (e.g., `Include`, `Match` blocks, token expansion beyond `%d`). Existing fallback chain remains to preserve robustness.

Tradeoffs and what might break: preferring explicit SSH config may change which key aivm selects on hosts with multiple key files; this is the desired behavior when users have configured defaults.

What I am confident about: added a targeted test proving config-file-first precedence (`tests/test_detect.py`) and detect/config-init test suites pass.

## 2026-02-27 21:48:34 +0000

Added explicit subnet-selection logging in `aivm/detect.py` so default-network detection reports which CIDR was selected. `pick_free_subnet()` now logs an info message when it finds a non-overlapping preferred subnet and a warning when it must fall back to the first candidate because all preferred ranges overlap current routes.

State of mind / reflection: this is a small observability improvement that makes network default behavior easier to reason about during setup/debugging.

Uncertainties / risks: logging frequency is low and tied to init/default-detection paths; minimal operational risk.

Tradeoffs and what might break: none expected beyond slightly noisier logs at info level during config-default computation.

What I am confident about: detect tests and compile checks pass after the change.

## 2026-02-27 21:56:26 +0000

Hardened base-image fetch atomicity in `aivm/vm/lifecycle.py`. `fetch_image()` now downloads to a same-directory temporary path (`<cache_name>.part`) and only moves it into the final cache filename after curl succeeds. On failure, it removes the temp file before re-raising, preventing partially downloaded files from being mistaken as valid cached images.

State of mind / reflection: this was a correctness/safety fix to align cache semantics with user expectations under interruption/cancellation scenarios.

Uncertainties / risks: temporary `.part` naming is deterministic per VM/image path; concurrent downloads for the exact same VM config could still contend on that temp filename. Current behavior is still materially safer than direct-to-final writes.

Tradeoffs and what might break: one extra `mv` and cleanup call in the happy path; minimal overhead for improved integrity.

What I am confident about: added regression test (`test_fetch_image_uses_atomic_temp_then_move`) and VM helper tests + syntax checks pass.

Addressed two issues from live usage. First, improved VM-create error handling when share mode is requested but host lacks `virtiofsd`: `aivm/vm/lifecycle.py` now detects that specific `virt-install` failure and raises a clearer actionable `RuntimeError` message instead of surfacing only the raw installer error chain. This applies to both normal and UEFI-fallback create attempts.

Second, expanded interactive `aivm config init` edit flow to include core VM hardware choices (`vm.user`, `vm.cpus`, `vm.ram_mb`, `vm.disk_gb`) and updated the default summary display to show those fields up front. Added integer-input validation for hardware fields.

State of mind / reflection: these are practical UX corrections directly informed by real runs. The virtiofsd issue is a host capability mismatch, so clarity matters more than silent retries; hardware controls in init reduce friction and prevent immediate post-init edits.

Uncertainties / risks: virtiofsd detection still relies on matching known `virt-install` error text; if upstream wording changes, enriched messaging could miss and fall back to raw error output.

Tradeoffs and what might break: init interaction now includes more prompts in edit mode; this is intentional for explicit control but slightly longer.

What I am confident about: targeted tests for both behaviors pass (`tests/test_vm_helpers.py`, `tests/test_cli_config_init.py`) and syntax checks are clean.

## 2026-02-27 22:06:11 +0000

Added hardware drift guidance for existing VM definitions after config edits. In `aivm/cli/vm.py`, `VMUpCLI` now checks live `virsh dominfo` vs configured `vm.cpus` / `vm.ram_mb` when bringing up an existing VM without `--recreate`. If drift is detected, it prints a non-destructive command recipe (`virsh setvcpus`, `setmaxmem`, `setmem`) and explicitly notes that these changes preserve disk/state.

State of mind / reflection: this closes an important UX gap where users could edit config expecting changes to apply, but existing domains remained unchanged silently. The goal was actionable clarity without taking risky implicit actions.

Uncertainties / risks: drift detection currently focuses on CPU and RAM only; other domain-definition changes still require manual judgment/recreate workflows. Parsing relies on `dominfo` output format but is simple and tested.

Tradeoffs and what might break: extra informational output appears on `vm up` when drift is present; this is intentional to prevent hidden mismatch confusion.

What I am confident about: added parser/drift tests in `tests/test_cli_status_helpers.py`, and related helper test suites pass.

## 2026-02-27 22:15:17 +0000

Completed a breaking state-model refactor to remove `vms.share` and consolidate share configuration into attachment records. Key changes: removed `ShareConfig` from `AgentVMConfig`; removed `[vms.share]` load/save handling in store serialization; bumped store schema default to `3`; updated share operations to take explicit attachment parameters (`source_dir`, `tag`, `guest_dst`) instead of reading from VM config fields; updated attached-session plumbing to carry share parameters in `PreparedSession` and persist them via `[[attachments]]` only.

State of mind / reflection: this was a high-surface-area cleanup but conceptually simplifying. The previous mixed model (VM-embedded share config + attachment table) caused drift and confusing ownership of share state. Unifying on attachments makes behavior easier to reason about and aligns with the intended workflow.

Uncertainties / risks: this intentionally drops backward compatibility for `vms.share` entries in existing config stores. Also, VM create paths now only include virtiofs mapping when share info is explicitly provided by attach/code/ssh flows, which changes behavior for users who previously relied on VM config embedded share defaults.

Tradeoffs and what might break: direct `vm up` no longer implicitly provisions share mappings because there is no share state in VM config. This is consistent with attachment-first design but may surprise old workflows.

What I am confident about: full test suite passes (`61 passed, 1 skipped`) after refactor, including CLI, store, detect, status, and VM helper coverage.

## 2026-02-27 22:24:45 +0000

Implemented the first structural refactor pass after share-model consolidation: introduced a unified attachment resolution layer in `aivm/cli/vm.py` (`ResolvedAttachment` + `_resolve_attachment`, `_align_attachment_tag_with_mappings`, `_attachment_has_mapping`) and rewired both `vm attach` and attached-session preparation (`code`/`ssh` path) to use it.

State of mind / reflection: this was a good seam to extract first because attachment tag/guest-destination derivation had started to drift between code paths. Centralizing those decisions reduces subtle behavior mismatches and makes follow-on VM reconcile refactor cleaner.

Uncertainties / risks: the resolver currently lives in `cli/vm.py` rather than a dedicated module, so ownership is clearer than before but still CLI-scoped. If reuse expands, moving to a shared attachment utility module may be warranted.

Tradeoffs and what might break: this touched hot paths for attach/code/ssh, so regression risk was non-trivial; mitigated by full-suite run.

What I am confident about: all tests pass (`61 passed, 1 skipped`) and compile checks are clean after the refactor.

## 2026-02-27 22:29:02 +0000

Completed the larger reconcile-layer refactor for attached VM workflows in `aivm/cli/vm.py`. Introduced explicit policy/result objects (`ReconcilePolicy`, `ReconcileResult`) and extracted the state transition engine into `_reconcile_attached_vm(...)`, which now centralizes optimistic probes + privileged reconciliation for network/firewall/vm/share in one place. `_prepare_attached_session(...)` is now primarily orchestration/wiring around resolver + reconcile + final SSH mount/setup.

State of mind / reflection: this is the right structural boundary for current code size. The previous giant function mixed attachment resolution, plan decisions, action execution, and final session return; splitting it gives a coherent reconcile API that can evolve into a dedicated module later if needed.

Uncertainties / risks: reconcile logic still lives in `cli/vm.py` and depends on local helper functions; if we later want cross-command reuse beyond attach/code/ssh, moving this into `aivm/vm/reconcile.py` with more formal dependency injection may be worthwhile.

Tradeoffs and what might break: there is some upfront abstraction overhead (extra dataclasses and call layers), but behavior remained unchanged and test coverage stayed green.

What I am confident about: full test suite passes (`61 passed, 1 skipped`) and compile checks pass; attach/code/ssh paths now share a clearer single reconciliation flow.

## 2026-02-28 02:27:26 +0000

Implemented configurable firewall port allowlists to permit selective VM access to host and blocked/private network services while keeping default isolation strict. Added `allow_tcp_ports` and `allow_udp_ports` to `FirewallConfig` in `aivm/config.py`, and wired them into nft rule generation in `aivm/firewall.py`.

Behavior: when allowlists are set, nft script now inserts explicit accept rules for those ports on bridge ingress in `input` (VM->host services) and before blocked-CIDR drops in `forward` (VM->private/LAN services on specified ports). Added port normalization/validation (dedupe + 1..65535 range) with clear runtime errors on invalid values.

State of mind / reflection: this fills a practical gap without weakening default stance. The key tradeoff was where to apply exceptions; applying both to host input and blocked-forward paths matches user intent (“host network or machine”) while preserving deny-by-default for everything else.

Uncertainties / risks: if users clear `block_cidrs` entirely, rule shape around blocked-CIDR clauses may become less meaningful; current behavior assumes normal non-empty block lists. Also, broad port allowlists can materially reduce isolation if misused.

What I am confident about: added firewall tests for allowlist rendering and invalid-port validation, updated README note, and full test suite passes (`63 passed, 1 skipped`).

## 2026-02-28 02:33:23 +0000

Added a new `aivm config lint` command to detect unknown/unused keys and sections in the config store TOML. Implemented linting in `aivm/cli/config.py` by parsing the raw TOML and validating top-level keys, `[[vms]]` record keys/section names, per-section field keys, and `[[attachments]]` keys. This now flags stale removed sections like `vms.share` explicitly.

State of mind / reflection: this complements recent breaking schema/model changes by giving users a direct way to discover stale config state instead of relying on silent ignore behavior.

Uncertainties / risks: lint currently focuses on structural key/section validity, not deep semantic validation (e.g., types/ranges for every field beyond TOML parsing and model-level usage).

Tradeoffs and what might break: `config lint` returns non-zero when issues are found, which is intentional and useful for CI/preflight checks.

What I am confident about: added focused lint tests (`tests/test_cli_config_lint.py`) and full suite remains green (`65 passed, 1 skipped`).

## 2026-02-28 15:12:44 +0000

Aligned docs/status wording with the new defaults-first flow where `aivm config init` sets baseline defaults and VM lifecycle is explicit via `aivm vm create` / `aivm vm destroy`. Updated `aivm/status.py` suggested next-step command from `vm up` to `vm create` when the VM is not defined, and adjusted the global status guidance line to call out init-then-create. Also updated README quickstart config-store flow to include `aivm vm create` immediately after `aivm config init`.

State of mind / reflection: this is a consistency pass, not new behavior, but it matters because users rely on status output as operational guidance. Inconsistent text would create friction right after the recent command model shift.

Uncertainties / risks: there may still be additional stale references in external docs (e.g., readthedocs pages not in this repo snapshot) that need the same wording update.

Tradeoffs and what might break: very low risk; the changes are user-facing messaging/docs only. The only behavioral impact is which command is suggested in status detail.

What I am confident about: changes are minimal and localized, and they align with the implemented CLI behavior already covered by existing tests.

## 2026-02-28 15:16:34 +0000

Updated `aivm vm destroy` to accept VM name as positional argument 1. Added `vm = scfg.Value('', position=1, ...)` to `VMDestroyCLI` and wired it through `_load_cfg_with_path(..., vm_opt=args.vm)` so explicit names bypass ambiguity and target the intended VM directly.

State of mind / reflection: this is a small but important CLI ergonomics fix; destroy should mirror create/attach style where a VM can be named inline without extra flags.

Uncertainties / risks: parser behavior for direct command-class unit invocation is quirky because `scriptconfig` reserves a special `--config` option in list-argv mode; tests should exercise the top-level modal parser path to reflect actual usage.

Tradeoffs and what might break: low risk change; omission of positional VM still retains prior resolution behavior via active/single VM selection.

What I am confident about: added parser-level test coverage in `tests/test_cli_vm_create.py` using `AgentVMModalCLI` invocation (`aivm vm destroy <name> ...`), and focused tests pass.

## 2026-02-28 15:27:34 +0000

Refactored store model to make networks first-class managed objects with VM references, without migration/back-compat handling. Added `Store.networks` and `NetworkEntry`, changed `VMEntry` to carry `network_name`, and updated serialization to persist `[[networks]]` + lean `[[vms]]` records (no embedded per-VM network/firewall sections). Added runtime materialization (`materialize_vm_cfg`) that resolves VM network/firewall by reference and fails clearly when a VM points to a missing network.

Wired CLI paths to the new model: `_load_cfg_with_path` now uses materialized VM config; VM record persistence now ensures referenced network is recorded; `vm create` auto-registers/uses network definitions from defaults; `host net` subcommands now resolve managed networks directly (even when no VMs exist), accept positional network name, and `host net destroy` guards against deleting in-use networks unless `--force` (guard skipped in dry-run).

State of mind / reflection: this is the right structural boundary to keep network lifecycle sane and independent. Treating network/firewall as shared resources avoids duplicated/conflicting per-VM settings and matches real libvirt semantics.

Uncertainties / risks: no migration means old stores with only per-VM network definitions will break until users reinitialize/recreate config in the new shape. That is intentional per current project direction.

Tradeoffs and what might break: stricter referential checks can surface errors earlier (missing network references), which is desirable but may feel abrupt. Force-destroying a network still allows creating dangling VM references; this remains a deliberate escape hatch.

What I am confident about: full suite passes after refactor (`68 passed, 1 skipped`), including updated lint/schema tests and dry-run command coverage.

## 2026-02-28 15:41:26 +0000

Added `aivm help raw` to print direct underlying system-tool commands that map to common `aivm` status/debug checks. Implemented in `aivm/cli/help.py` as `HelpRawCLI`, included in the help modal tree, and made it resolve VM/network/firewall targets from the config store when possible (active/specified/single VM heuristics), while still printing usable defaults when context is ambiguous.

State of mind / reflection: this is a practical transparency feature. Users can now inspect/debug with `virsh`/`nft`/`ssh` commands directly without reverse-engineering what `aivm` is doing under the hood.

Uncertainties / risks: command block currently assumes common defaults for some paths/users in the examples (e.g., image path root, SSH username) where exact values may differ; still useful as a mapping aid rather than exact execution transcript.

Tradeoffs and what might break: very low risk; this is additive command output. The new resolver logic in help is intentionally lightweight and non-authoritative.

What I am confident about: added tests for raw output and command tree inclusion (`tests/test_cli_helpers.py`, `tests/test_cli_dryrun.py`), and full suite passes (`69 passed, 1 skipped`).

## 2026-02-28 15:56:39 +0000

Added an interactive defaults-override review step to `aivm vm create` to mirror prior `config init` ergonomics, but scoped to VM creation time. `VMCreateCLI` now shows a summary and prompts `Use these values? [Y/e/n] (e=edit)` when `--yes` is not provided, allowing edits to VM identity/hardware and network settings before create/start.

State of mind / reflection: this aligns command intent with user workflow: `config init` sets baseline preferences; `vm create` is now where per-VM overrides are naturally applied.

Uncertainties / risks: if a user edits `network.name` to an existing managed network while also editing subnet fields, existing network definitions still take precedence by name. That behavior is consistent with first-class network ownership but may be surprising without explicit warning.

Tradeoffs and what might break: non-interactive runs still require `--yes`; now they also avoid the new review step. Interactive runs are one prompt longer by design.

What I am confident about: added tests for interactive edit and abort flows in `tests/test_cli_vm_create.py`; full suite remains green (`72 passed, 1 skipped`).

## 2026-02-28 17:59:44 +0000

Refactored VM resource sanity checks into a shared module (`aivm/resource_checks.py`) and reused it across both `vm create` and `config init` to reduce duplication. `vm create` continues to warn for “likely too high” resource requests and hard-fails for physically infeasible CPU/RAM requests. `config init` now emits the same warning class for baseline defaults so users see capacity concerns earlier while choosing defaults.

State of mind / reflection: this was a straightforward consolidation that also fixed UX timing: warnings now appear consistently from one source of truth in both workflows.

Uncertainties / risks: host-availability metrics (especially `MemAvailable`) are snapshot-based and can fluctuate quickly, so warnings/errors are best-effort guardrails rather than deterministic admission control.

Tradeoffs and what might break: moving checks into a shared module changed monkeypatch/test seams; tests were updated to patch shared check outputs instead of host-probe internals.

What I am confident about: added config-init coverage for shared resource warnings, updated vm-create tests, and full suite is green (`75 passed, 1 skipped`).

## 2026-02-28 18:05:45 +0000

Adjusted resource warning and VM-create error reporting based on real nested-VM behavior. RAM warnings now prioritize `MemTotal` (stable capacity signal) instead of warning on low transient `MemAvailable` snapshots that were producing false positives. Hard feasibility checks already use `MemTotal`/CPU only. Also changed `virt-install` UEFI-first attempt handling to avoid surfacing a noisy error log when UEFI is unavailable but non-UEFI fallback succeeds.

State of mind / reflection: this was a practical correction from production-like logs. The previous warning/error shape was technically derived from system metrics but not aligned with user expectations in constrained virtualized hosts.

Uncertainties / risks: disk-warning heuristics remain conservative and may still produce advisory warnings in sparse-image scenarios; keeping it warning-only avoids blocking.

Tradeoffs and what might break: first-attempt `virt-install` now uses non-throwing path and manually promotes failures, which slightly changes control flow but preserves explicit errors for real failures.

What I am confident about: added/updated tests in `tests/test_resource_checks.py` and verified VM helper fallback behavior; full suite passes (`78 passed, 1 skipped`).

## 2026-02-28 18:33:55 +0000

Applied `special_options=False` explicitly to all `cls.cli(...)` invocations in `aivm/cli/*` to avoid scriptconfig special-option interactions (notably around `--config`/short-flag parsing behavior). This keeps parsing behavior predictable and decoupled from scriptconfig’s special-option machinery while preserving existing command semantics.

State of mind / reflection: this is a targeted parser hardening change motivated by observed scriptconfig quirks. It’s low complexity and improves determinism.

Uncertainties / risks: if any command previously relied on special options implicitly (e.g., uncommon scriptconfig-level meta flags), those are now disabled by design.

Tradeoffs and what might break: help and normal subcommand parsing remain intact; only scriptconfig special-option paths are suppressed.

What I am confident about: full suite remains green after the change (`78 passed, 1 skipped`).

## 2026-02-28 18:47:12 +0000

Reversed the prior parser hard-disable and moved toward scriptconfig-native argument handling as requested. Removed `special_options=False` from all command `cls.cli(...)` calls, added `_BaseCommand.__post_init__` to centralize logging setup from parsed args/config context, and trimmed manual argv normalization to only legacy top-level/subcommand name aliases (kept `init`/`ls` and hyphenated subcommand names). Also made `host_src` positional in code/ssh/attach command definitions so scriptconfig handles those directly without argv rewriting.

State of mind / reflection: this is a cleaner architecture boundary: scriptconfig parses, commands consume normalized config, and `_BaseCommand` handles cross-cutting setup in one place.

Uncertainties / risks: a small amount of name-alias normalization remains in `main` for backward-compatible command spellings; if we want to go fully strict later, that shim can be removed in one step.

Tradeoffs and what might break: direct unit-style invocation patterns that depended on parser quirks may shift with special options re-enabled, but command behavior through `aivm ...` stays stable.

What I am confident about: test suite is fully green after this refactor (`78 passed, 1 skipped`).

## 2026-02-28 19:23:50 +0000

Completed the next parser cleanup pass: removed argv munging from `aivm.cli.main.main(...)` entirely and now pass argv directly to `AgentVMModalCLI.main(...)`. Also set `_BaseCommand.__special_options__ = False` so scriptconfig special-option behavior is consistently disabled via class configuration rather than per-call flags. Deleted old `_normalize_argv` and `_count_verbose` helpers and updated helper tests that imported those private functions.

State of mind / reflection: this is closer to the desired boundary where scriptconfig owns parsing behavior and aivm avoids maintaining a parallel argv rewrite layer.

Uncertainties / risks: dropping normalization removes compatibility shims for legacy aliases (`init`, `ls`, hyphenated subcommand forms). This is intentional based on current direction, but users/scripts depending on those aliases may need adjustment.

Tradeoffs and what might break: convenience alias behavior is the primary likely impact; core command parsing and execution remain intact.

What I am confident about: full suite passes after removal (`76 passed, 1 skipped`), including CLI command-path tests.

## 2026-02-28 21:19:38 +0000

Refactored command side effects out of `_BaseCommand.__post_init__` into an overridden `_BaseCommand.cli(...)` flow. The classmethod now calls `super().cli(...)`, resolves config-driven verbosity from parsed args, and then performs logging setup once per actual command parse path. Simplified global state by removing request-key caching and keeping only idempotent `_setup_logging` state guard keyed by effective `(level, colorize)`.

State of mind / reflection: this is a cleaner lifecycle boundary: parse first, then side effects based on parsed values. It avoids parser-construction churn from `__post_init__` while keeping config reads explicit and safe.

Uncertainties / risks: repeated command parses still perform config reads (intentional to avoid stale-config footguns), which leaves some overhead in dryrun aggregation tests.

Tradeoffs and what might break: moving logic into `cli` override depends on scriptconfig call ordering contracts; current tests confirm behavior but this is a coupling to monitor if scriptconfig internals change.

What I am confident about: full test suite remains green (`76 passed, 1 skipped`) and targeted dryrun test remains substantially improved over pre-optimization baseline.
