Session focused on stabilizing `aivm code .` after reboot and stale VM/config state. The main decision was to prioritize robustness for bad runtime state (stale libvirt definitions, missing sudo ticket, broken probe gating) without adding broader legacy-config compatibility work. Key fixes landed across `aivm/cli/_common.py`, `aivm/cli/vm.py`, `aivm/vm/lifecycle.py`, and `aivm/util.py`: warming sudo credentials after privileged confirmation, reordering VM start/create flow to avoid unnecessary image fetch on existing stopped VMs, detecting stale virtiofs-source startup errors and forcing recreate path, hardening domain teardown before recreate (multiple undefine strategies + verify gone), improving logging caller attribution via Loguru depth, and improving wait-for-IP UX with periodic progress diagnostics and explicit “may be booting vs hung” messaging.

The dominant challenge was layered failure modes that looked similar at CLI level but had different root causes (sudo ticket expiration, stale share path in domain XML, domain not actually undefined, guest booting to initramfs, firewall state inconclusive without sudo, and no DHCP/`domifaddr` visibility while VM reported running). We added recovery logic where safe, but there is still uncertainty about guest-network bring-up reliability under strict firewall policy and first-boot cloud-init timing. To reduce boot stalls, cloud-init generation now constrains datasource to NoCloud and writes seed `network-config` with optional DHCP interfaces; wait-online services are also masked. Tradeoff: this speeds boot and avoids external metadata probing, but may hide networking issues that would otherwise fail loudly; if interface naming differs unexpectedly, optional netplan entries may still not match. Confident: command-level regressions are low-risk and compile checks passed for touched modules. Not yet confident: end-to-end boot/network readiness across host environments and all libvirt/network backend variations.

Potential breakpoints to watch: recreate path storage semantics (`--remove-all-storage`), VM guest identity/cache mismatch after forced recreate, and firewall behavior when probes run unprivileged first then privileged fallback. Suggested next validation: full clean destroy/recreate cycle, capture `aivm code . -vvv --yes` timing before/after, and verify guest obtains DHCP lease + SSH readiness without manual VM-manager intervention.

Reflection/state of mind: this session felt like peeling an onion of interacting host/guest state bugs where each fix exposed the next bottleneck. I’m confident the debugging direction is now coherent (logs are more attributable, wait states are more visible, and bad/stale VM definitions are handled more explicitly), but I’m not fully confident the current behavior is stable across clean-room boots and different host libvirt setups yet. The work shifted from “single bug fix” to “resilience pass,” and I intentionally chose pragmatic guardrails over deep architectural refactors to keep momentum and reduce blast radius.

Uncertainties/risks: guest boot/network timing is still the biggest unknown, especially with strict firewall settings and virtualization/network stack variance; cloud-init + wait-online behavior can differ by image version and renderer. Recreate flows now do stronger teardown checks, but storage lifecycle edge-cases (NVRAM/snapshots/leftover disks) could still surprise users. Probe-driven branching may still miss rare mixed states (e.g., stale cached IP combined with partial guest boot).

Tradeoffs and what might break: adding aggressive self-healing/recreate behavior improves recovery from stale configs but can hide root causes and may surprise users who expected strictly non-destructive correction paths. For networking, forcing NoCloud and optional DHCP reduces boot blocking but may allow system boot to proceed with unresolved network, moving failure later in workflow instead of during early boot. Logging depth changes rely on formatter conventions; if formatter changes, caller attribution quality could regress.

What I am confident about: the command-path correctness around sudo prompting/ticketing and start-vs-create ordering is materially better than before; stale virtiofs path detection is now explicit; and wait-for-IP UX is improved with status-oriented feedback instead of silent loops. Syntax checks passed for all touched modules, and the code paths now surface clearer diagnostics to guide the next iteration.

## 2026-02-26 12:59:09 -0500

State of mind / reflection: confidence increased materially after host-side packet capture confirmed a concrete network-path root cause (guest DHCP discover sent, no offer returned). The work shifted from uncertain guest-side debugging to a specific host firewall rule correction, which reduced ambiguity and made the system behavior understandable again.

What happened: patched firewall generation in `aivm/firewall.py` so DHCP on the VM bridge is accepted regardless of destination IP (broadcast discover to `255.255.255.255` was previously dropped by the bridge input rule). User reported successful access into the new VM after applying changes.

Uncertainties / risks: there may still be edge conditions around guest init timing, cloud-init final stage failures, or libvirt lease visibility lag. MAC churn across recreate cycles can still confuse expectations when correlating static reservations/logs, though it does not explain this specific DHCP drop once firewall is corrected.

Tradeoffs: firewall remains intentionally strict for guest->host bridge traffic; widening DHCP allowance was scoped narrowly to bridge ingress UDP ports 67/68 to preserve isolation intent while restoring baseline network boot behavior.

What might break: if environments rely on custom DHCP relay behavior or non-standard bridge/interface wiring, the current assumption that DHCP should always be accepted on bridge ingress could be too permissive or insufficiently specific.

What I am confident about: root cause for the observed timeout loop in this session was the firewall DHCP destination constraint; fix is targeted, low-risk, and aligned with observed packet traces.

## 2026-02-26 13:41:22 -0500

Reflection/state of mind: this refactor felt like the right time to simplify aggressively because the old dual-model (registry + per-VM files + optional local metadata) was creating confusion in code paths and UX. I’m more confident in maintainability now because the state model is singular and explicit, but I’m also aware this was a large conceptual rename and therefore carries integration risk in edge CLI flows not covered by tests.

What changed at a high level: removed the old registry concept and renamed it to a single config store model, centered on `~/.config/aivm/config.toml` with `[[vms]]` and `[[attachments]]`. Reworked CLI resolution and persistence (`aivm/cli/_common.py`, `aivm/cli/config.py`, `aivm/cli/vm.py`, `aivm/cli/main.py`, `aivm/status.py`) to use store APIs only. Deleted `aivm/registry.py`, introduced `aivm/store.py`, replaced registry test with store test (`tests/test_store.py`), and updated existing CLI dry-run tests to build store files directly.

Uncertainties/risks: migration for existing users is manual and currently external (by design), so stale legacy files in real environments may cause user confusion until migrated. There is still potential for semantic drift where “config store path” and “resolved VM selection” behavior may surprise users in ambiguous multi-VM cases. Help text and docs were updated, but there may be remaining narrative mismatches outside core README.

Tradeoffs and what might break: this intentionally drops backward compatibility and local metadata support, reducing complexity but breaking old workflows that relied on `.aivm.toml` or `.aivm-dir.toml`. The compose-like embedded VM config in TOML triple-quoted strings optimizes simplicity and reuse of existing config serializer, but is not as elegant as fully normalized nested TOML structures and may be harder to hand-edit carefully.

What I am confident about: core code compiles, imports cleanly, and tests pass (`36 passed`). CLI smoke checks for config init/path/list with custom `--config` store path are working. The project is now aligned with a single-source-of-truth state model, which should make future iteration on VM selection and attachment UX much cleaner.

## 2026-02-26 20:33:15 +0000

Worked on tightening confirmation boundaries around user-owned files by gating `~/.ssh/config` edits in the `aivm vm code` path behind an interactive prompt unless `--yes` is supplied. Added a dedicated helper (`_confirm_external_file_update`) in `aivm/cli/_common.py`, wired it into `_upsert_ssh_config_entry` in `aivm/cli/vm.py`, and adjusted shared `--yes` help text to reflect broader confirmation semantics.

State of mind / reflection: this was a small but important policy-consistency change; I wanted the behavior to mirror the existing sudo confirmation UX without over-coupling file-edit confirmation to privileged-operation logic. The clearest tradeoff was adding one more interactive checkpoint for `vm code` users who are not using `--yes`, but that aligns with explicit-consent expectations for modifying unmanaged files.

Uncertainties / risks: there may be other code paths (now or later) that touch user-owned files and should also use the same helper; those would need a follow-up audit. Behavior in non-interactive environments now intentionally fails fast unless `--yes` is set, which is correct for safety but could surprise scripts that relied on implicit writes.

What might break: workflows that call `aivm vm code` in non-interactive sessions without `--yes` will now error before writing SSH config. Confident this is intended behavior and matches the safety contract. Added targeted unit tests in `tests/test_cli_helpers.py` for `--yes` bypass, non-interactive refusal, and explicit abort response.

## 2026-02-27 17:20:06 +0000

Worked on a follow-up to SSH-config confirmation flow: avoid asking for external-file update permission when `~/.ssh/config` does not need to change. Updated `_upsert_ssh_config_entry` in `aivm/cli/vm.py` to read and compute the post-upsert content first, return early when unchanged, and only invoke `_confirm_external_file_update` immediately before an actual write.

State of mind / reflection: this was a precision fix motivated by friction in real usage. The previous behavior was safety-correct but ergonomically noisy because it treated idempotent runs as mutating operations. The revised order keeps the same safety guarantee for writes while honoring the principle of skipping unnecessary privileged/consent flows when we can infer no-op behavior.

Uncertainties / risks: newline normalization and block-matching regex semantics are still the critical edge points; if a user has hand-edited spacing inside the managed block, we still classify that as a write-needed update, which is expected but could trigger prompt surprise. Also, if the file does not exist, this remains a write path and still requires confirmation unless `--yes` is set.

Tradeoffs and what might break: preserving prompt-on-write means non-interactive automation without `--yes` still fails for true updates, by design. The main tradeoff is slightly more logic in the upsert path to avoid false-positive prompts. Added regression coverage in `tests/test_cli_helpers.py` (`test_upsert_ssh_config_no_confirm_when_unchanged`) to lock behavior for non-interactive, unchanged re-upsert.

Validation: `pytest -q tests/test_cli_helpers.py` passed (8 tests).

## 2026-02-27 17:26:07 +0000

Worked on restoring colored Loguru output for interactive CLI runs. The issue was self-inflicted in `aivm/cli/main.py`: `_setup_logging` forced `colorize=False`, which disabled level/message colors unconditionally even in a terminal. I changed setup to derive `colorize` from runtime conditions (`sys.stderr.isatty()` and `NO_COLOR` not set), and updated the log format to wrap level/message in `<level>...</level>` markup so color application is explicit.

State of mind / reflection: this was a straightforward quality-of-life fix, but it highlighted an important ergonomics-vs-portability balance. I wanted to preserve clean redirected output while making interactive diagnostics visually scannable again. Choosing auto-color with `NO_COLOR` compliance felt like the most pragmatic middle ground with minimal behavioral surprise.

Uncertainties / risks: terminal/color behavior can still vary with host environment variables (`NO_COLOR`, `TERM`) and PTY handling. In this environment `NO_COLOR=1`, so color stays disabled by design; users expecting color in such environments will need to unset that variable.

Tradeoffs and what might break: adding `<level>` markup scopes coloring to level and message fields; if users parse stderr logs with strict plain-text expectations in TTY mode, ANSI codes may now appear where they previously did not. Redirected/non-TTY output remains uncolored.

What I am confident about: syntax checks passed via `python -m py_compile aivm/*.py aivm/cli/*.py aivm/vm/*.py`, and logging setup now aligns with typical terminal-color conventions without forcing color into non-interactive sinks.

## 2026-02-27 17:30:18 +0000

Adjusted the logging formatter in `aivm/cli/main.py` to more closely match Loguru’s default color scheme after feedback. Kept the existing field layout (time, level, caller, message) but switched color tags to default-style palette: green timestamp, level-colored severity/message, and cyan caller components.

State of mind / reflection: this was a fast refinement to align visual expectations rather than functional behavior. The previous fix restored conditional coloring, but the palette emphasized only level/message; this update makes output feel immediately familiar to users accustomed to stock Loguru defaults.

Uncertainties / risks: exact appearance still depends on terminal theme capabilities and environment flags like `NO_COLOR`; if that variable is present, colors remain intentionally disabled.

Tradeoffs and what might break: no behavior change to verbosity/routing, only formatter styling. Any tooling that expects plain uncolored text in TTY mode may still need `NO_COLOR=1`.

What I am confident about: compile checks still pass and formatter now tracks Loguru’s default visual language more closely while preserving caller detail.

## 2026-02-27 17:59:28 +0000

Implemented runtime environment detection in status reporting so users can quickly see whether `aivm` is running on a host system or inside a virtualized guest. Added `probe_runtime_environment()` in `aivm/status.py` with layered detection: `systemd-detect-virt` when available, fallback to `/proc/cpuinfo` hypervisor flag, and DMI product-name heuristics before yielding unknown. Wired this into both scoped and global status outputs, with extra diagnostics in `--detail` mode.

State of mind / reflection: this was intentionally narrow and low-risk to improve observability before building nested-VM tooling. I focused on best-effort signals that are usually available without elevated privileges, while avoiding hard failures when host capabilities differ.

Uncertainties / risks: virtualization detection is heuristic and environment-dependent; some bare-metal systems with unusual firmware strings or containerized contexts may remain “unknown” or occasionally misclassified. Current logic optimizes for non-invasive checks rather than exhaustive platform-specific detection.

Tradeoffs and what might break: status output gains one additional line (`Runtime environment`), which may affect consumers parsing status text verbatim. I kept existing progress-check accounting unchanged to avoid changing completion ratios based on heuristic detection.

What I am confident about: targeted tests cover guest/host/unknown branches and global status wiring (`tests/test_status_runtime.py`), and related status helper tests still pass. Compile checks pass for touched modules.

## 2026-02-27 20:36:23 +0000

Adjusted `aivm help plan` command rendering so it only includes `--config <path>` when using a non-default config-store path. Kept the plan header line showing the resolved config path for visibility, but removed repeated `--config` noise from suggested commands when the path is the default store.

State of mind / reflection: this was a small UX polish with high signal-to-noise value. The existing output was technically correct but overly verbose in the common case; this change makes the quick-copy workflow cleaner without hiding which config is active.

Uncertainties / risks: command-string assertions can be sensitive to future formatting changes in the plan template. I added focused tests to lock intended behavior for default vs custom config paths.

Tradeoffs and what might break: users who relied on always seeing explicit `--config` in plan commands may need to infer the default path from the header line. Non-default paths remain explicit in every command, preserving safety for multi-config workflows.

What I am confident about: helper tests now cover both branches (`tests/test_cli_helpers.py`) and pass locally, and compile checks remain clean.

## 2026-02-27 20:45:27 +0000

Addressed a sudo UX bug affecting VM-side workflows: `_confirm_sudo_block` would proactively run `sudo -v` even when `--yes` was supplied, which could trigger an unnecessary password prompt in environments where `sudo -v` policy differs from command-level sudo usage. Updated `aivm/cli/_common.py` so `--yes` bypasses interactive confirmation *and* skips sudo-ticket warmup.

State of mind / reflection: this was a good reminder that convenience preflight checks can become correctness bugs when they are stricter than the real execution path. The right behavior for `--yes` is “do not block on interactive sudo validation”; command execution can still fail naturally where privileges are truly unavailable.

Uncertainties / risks: skipping `sudo -v` under `--yes` means first privileged command failure may now happen deeper in the command path rather than upfront. That is acceptable and more consistent with non-interactive semantics.

Tradeoffs and what might break: users who liked eager sudo-cache warming with `--yes` lose that behavior; interactive non-`--yes` flow still keeps existing confirmation + `sudo -v` warmup.

What I am confident about: added regression coverage in `tests/test_cli_helpers.py` (`test_confirm_sudo_block_yes_skips_sudo_validate`) and helper test suite passes.

## 2026-02-27 20:50:18 +0000

Refined sudo confirmation behavior to better support VM environments with passwordless sudo. Added `_has_passwordless_sudo()` in `aivm/cli/_common.py` and integrated it into `_confirm_sudo_block()`: before any interactive `sudo -v` warmup, the code now probes `sudo -n true`; if that succeeds, it marks sudo as validated and skips `sudo -v` entirely.

State of mind / reflection: this adjustment better aligns policy intent (explicit confirmation unless `--yes`) with practical execution realities in nested/guest contexts where sudo is available non-interactively. The previous eager `sudo -v` check could be stricter than actual command execution and therefore blocked valid workflows.

Uncertainties / risks: `sudo -n true` behavior can vary under custom sudoers policy; in rare setups it may fail despite other commands succeeding with different policy tags. Current fallback still uses the previous `sudo -v` prompt path after explicit confirmation.

Tradeoffs and what might break: this adds one extra lightweight sudo probe call (`sudo -n true`) per process until cached validation is set. That slight overhead is intentional to avoid unnecessary password prompts.

What I am confident about: helper tests now cover both `--yes` and non-`--yes` passwordless-sudo branches and pass (`tests/test_cli_helpers.py`). Compile checks remain clean.

## 2026-02-27 20:54:10 +0000

Adjusted host dependency installation command execution to stream output for long-running operations. In `aivm/host.py`, switched `run_cmd(..., capture=True)` to `capture=False` for `apt-get update`, `apt-get install`, and the follow-up `systemctl enable --now libvirtd` call so users can observe progress and troubleshoot stalls in real time.

State of mind / reflection: this was an operator-visibility improvement with low technical risk and high usability payoff. Silent capture is fine for short probes, but long installs should be transparent by default.

Uncertainties / risks: uncaptured output is noisier, but this command is explicitly operational and long-running, so verbosity is expected. Error handling semantics remain unchanged.

Tradeoffs and what might break: tests that assumed only command ordering (and ignored kwargs) needed a slight update to assert capture behavior explicitly.

What I am confident about: host tests now validate the non-capturing behavior for apt calls, helper tests still pass, and compile checks are clean.

## 2026-02-27 20:58:51 +0000

Added an opt-in end-to-end nested smoke test in `tests/test_e2e_nested.py` that runs the real CLI via `python -m aivm` against an isolated temporary config store. The flow provisions unique VM/network names, creates host network, brings VM up, waits for IP, checks status, and performs best-effort cleanup (VM destroy + network destroy) in `finally`.

State of mind / reflection: I kept this intentionally pragmatic and operationally safe. E2E coverage is valuable here, but default test runs should stay fast and deterministic, so the test is guarded behind `AIVM_E2E=1` and preflight checks for SSH key availability + passwordless sudo.

Uncertainties / risks: this test depends on host/libvirt state, networking availability, and image cache/download behavior, so runtime and reliability will vary by environment. It is a smoke test, not a full conformance suite.

Tradeoffs and what might break: assertions are intentionally lightweight (`vm ip`/`cached vm ip`, `vm state`) to reduce false negatives across minor output changes; this sacrifices strictness in exchange for portability.

What I am confident about: default CI/local test runs are unaffected (test skips unless explicitly enabled), targeted test invocation works, and syntax checks pass.

## 2026-02-27 21:02:12 +0000

Refined the opt-in nested E2E smoke test to remove dependency on user-global SSH identities. `tests/test_e2e_nested.py` now generates a temporary ed25519 keypair with `ssh-keygen`, writes an isolated `~/.ssh/config` under a temp HOME, and runs all `python -m aivm` subprocesses with that HOME in env. VM config paths (`ssh_identity_file`, `ssh_pubkey_path`) now point to these ephemeral files.

State of mind / reflection: this change makes the E2E path much more reproducible and safer for local developer environments by avoiding hidden reliance on personal `~/.ssh` state. The test setup is now explicit and self-contained.

Uncertainties / risks: environments lacking `ssh-keygen` will skip this E2E path; that is acceptable for an opt-in integration test. Runtime variability from libvirt/network/image operations remains unchanged.

Tradeoffs and what might break: added setup work per run (small keygen overhead) in exchange for deterministic SSH material provisioning.

What I am confident about: default runs still skip unless `AIVM_E2E=1`, and syntax/targeted test checks pass with the new setup.

## 2026-02-27 21:05:56 +0000

Updated nested E2E CLI runner to stream live subprocess output while still capturing it for assertions and failure diagnostics. In `tests/test_e2e_nested.py`, replaced `subprocess.run(..., capture_output=True)` with a `Popen` + line-by-line tee loop (`stderr` merged into `stdout`) so `pytest -s` shows command progress in real time.

State of mind / reflection: this was important observability plumbing for long-running integration steps. Silent capture made failures expensive to debug because the only signal appeared after timeout/error. Live tee output lowers debugging latency significantly.

Uncertainties / risks: merged stderr/stdout sacrifices channel separation, but preserves chronological visibility which is more valuable for this smoke test.

Tradeoffs and what might break: output volume is larger when running with `-s`, by design. The runner still retains captured output for final assertions and failure messages.

What I am confident about: the test module still skips cleanly by default, syntax checks pass, and the new runner behavior is aligned with interactive debugging needs.

## 2026-02-27 21:10:10 +0000

Addressed nested E2E failure caused by missing UEFI firmware in the test environment and reduced smoke-test VM footprint. In `aivm/vm/lifecycle.py`, `create_or_start_vm()` now catches `virt-install` failures that specifically indicate missing x86_64 UEFI firmware and retries VM creation once without the `--boot uefi` arguments. Added a unit regression test in `tests/test_vm_helpers.py` to lock this fallback path.

Also updated `tests/test_e2e_nested.py` to use lower resource settings for smoke runs (`1 vCPU`, `2048 MB RAM`, `16 GB disk`) to better fit nested test environments.

State of mind / reflection: this is a pragmatic resilience improvement. Strict UEFI-only boot is ideal where available, but failing hard on hosts without OVMF blocks otherwise-valid smoke coverage. A targeted retry on one known error keeps behavior predictable while improving portability.

Uncertainties / risks: non-UEFI fallback may behave differently for some guest images/boot paths, though Ubuntu cloud images generally support legacy boot in common libvirt setups. Fallback is intentionally narrow to avoid masking unrelated `virt-install` errors.

Tradeoffs and what might break: hosts expecting UEFI-specific behavior (secure boot assumptions, firmware-variable workflows) will now silently run BIOS fallback when UEFI binaries are absent; this is primarily relevant in constrained environments and is logged as a warning.

What I am confident about: regression test covers the fallback trigger and command retry shape; targeted test suite and compile checks pass.

## 2026-02-27 21:14:51 +0000

Changed nested E2E image strategy to default to a user-level shared cache instead of independent per-run network download. In `tests/test_e2e_nested.py`, added `_ensure_user_cached_image()` and wiring so, unless `AIVM_E2E_INDEPENDENT_IMAGE=1`, the test populates/uses `~/.cache/aivm/e2e/noble-base.img` (or `AIVM_E2E_SHARED_IMAGE`) and points VM image URL to `file://...`.

State of mind / reflection: this aligns test cost with what we actually care about validating. Downloading cloud images repeatedly is noise for this smoke test and slows iteration without improving confidence in VM lifecycle logic.

Uncertainties / risks: the per-run VM image path still causes a local file copy from the shared cache (via existing fetch logic) rather than direct in-place reuse; this keeps behavior stable but does not fully eliminate I/O overhead.

Tradeoffs and what might break: default behavior now depends on local curl/file URL handling and a persistent user cache path. Independent mode remains available via env flag for clean-room testing.

What I am confident about: default test-run behavior remains opt-in and skip-safe, and syntax/targeted test checks pass after this change.

## 2026-02-27 21:38:32 +0000

Implemented a more interactive `aivm config init` flow to make default choices explicit before persisting config. Added a new `--defaults` flag to `config init` and changed behavior so, unless `--yes` or `--defaults` is supplied, init now prints a detailed detected-default summary and asks user confirmation (`[Y/e/n]`), with an edit path to adjust key fields inline before save.

State of mind / reflection: this change improves user trust and visibility without overcomplicating the first-run path. The main goal was making implicit auto-detection decisions visible and user-approved by default in interactive sessions.

Uncertainties / risks: inline edit prompts currently cover high-impact fields but are still text-based and minimal; users can still use `config edit` for full control after init. Prompt wording/output can drift over time and may require upkeep in tests.

Tradeoffs and what might break: non-interactive `config init` now errors unless `--yes` or `--defaults` is provided. This is intentional for explicitness but could affect unattended scripts that previously relied on implicit defaults.

What I am confident about: added targeted tests for non-interactive enforcement, `--defaults` bypass, and interactive summary confirmation (`tests/test_cli_config_init.py`), and existing CLI helper/dry-run tests still pass.

## 2026-02-27 21:41:39 +0000

Added explicit SSH-key setup warnings to `aivm config init` when detected identity/public key paths are missing on disk. The init flow now prints actionable guidance with a concrete `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 ...` command and a follow-up `aivm config init --force` reminder. Warning appears during interactive review and also in non-interactive `--yes/--defaults` paths.

State of mind / reflection: this is a small but high-value usability guardrail. Missing SSH keys are a common first-run blocker; surfacing the fix at init time is better than deferring to later SSH/provision failures.

Uncertainties / risks: warning is currently tied to detected file existence; users with atypical key management (hardware tokens, agent-only keys, non-file identities) may see a warning they can safely ignore.

Tradeoffs and what might break: init output is slightly noisier, intentionally. The warning is advisory only and does not block config creation.

What I am confident about: added test coverage for both interactive and defaults flows (`tests/test_cli_config_init.py`) and related CLI tests pass.

## 2026-02-27 21:42:49 +0000

Adjusted `aivm config init` to stop auto-populating `share.host_src` with the current working directory. The command still uses host/network/SSH auto-detection defaults, but now explicitly clears share source during init so host-folder exposure only occurs through explicit attach/code workflows.

State of mind / reflection: this aligns init semantics with least-surprise and least-exposure principles. Auto-sharing cwd at init was convenient but easy to misinterpret as implicit permission/attachment state.

Uncertainties / risks: users accustomed to previous behavior may need one extra explicit attach/code step before first use. This is a UX tradeoff in favor of safety and intentionality.

Tradeoffs and what might break: tests and summary output expectations needed updates because `share.host_src` now defaults to empty in init-created configs.

What I am confident about: targeted CLI init/helper/dryrun tests pass with assertions covering empty `share.host_src` persistence and interactive summary display.

## 2026-02-27 21:43:45 +0000

Refined SSH-key advisory behavior in `aivm config init`: missing-key guidance now emits through Loguru (`log.warning(...)`) in addition to human-readable CLI output, and removed the previous “re-run with --force” suggestion. The warning is now explicitly advisory-only messaging and does not imply required follow-up init reruns.

State of mind / reflection: this keeps diagnostic signal visible in both structured logs and terminal UX while avoiding prescriptive/incorrect remediation steps. The intent is to inform, not alter control flow.

Uncertainties / risks: duplicate visibility (stdout + log warning) is intentional, but may feel noisy at higher verbosity levels; acceptable for setup-time advisories.

Tradeoffs and what might break: tests needed minor updates to validate log-warning emission instead of older textual guidance.

What I am confident about: targeted config-init tests pass and include coverage that a log warning is produced when key files are missing.

## 2026-02-27 21:46:06 +0000

Updated SSH identity auto-detection to explicitly inspect `~/.ssh/config` first before falling back to existing `ssh -G` and key-file heuristics. Added `_detect_identity_from_ssh_config()` in `aivm/detect.py` that parses `Host` + `IdentityFile` directives (including `Host *` defaults) and resolves `%d`/`~` paths prior to existence checks.

State of mind / reflection: this change addresses a real user expectation mismatch. If a default `IdentityFile` is intentionally set in SSH config, aivm should honor it before choosing conventional key filenames.

Uncertainties / risks: parser intentionally handles common cases and does not yet implement full OpenSSH config semantics (e.g., `Include`, `Match` blocks, token expansion beyond `%d`). Existing fallback chain remains to preserve robustness.

Tradeoffs and what might break: preferring explicit SSH config may change which key aivm selects on hosts with multiple key files; this is the desired behavior when users have configured defaults.

What I am confident about: added a targeted test proving config-file-first precedence (`tests/test_detect.py`) and detect/config-init test suites pass.

## 2026-02-27 21:48:34 +0000

Added explicit subnet-selection logging in `aivm/detect.py` so default-network detection reports which CIDR was selected. `pick_free_subnet()` now logs an info message when it finds a non-overlapping preferred subnet and a warning when it must fall back to the first candidate because all preferred ranges overlap current routes.

State of mind / reflection: this is a small observability improvement that makes network default behavior easier to reason about during setup/debugging.

Uncertainties / risks: logging frequency is low and tied to init/default-detection paths; minimal operational risk.

Tradeoffs and what might break: none expected beyond slightly noisier logs at info level during config-default computation.

What I am confident about: detect tests and compile checks pass after the change.

## 2026-02-27 21:56:26 +0000

Hardened base-image fetch atomicity in `aivm/vm/lifecycle.py`. `fetch_image()` now downloads to a same-directory temporary path (`<cache_name>.part`) and only moves it into the final cache filename after curl succeeds. On failure, it removes the temp file before re-raising, preventing partially downloaded files from being mistaken as valid cached images.

State of mind / reflection: this was a correctness/safety fix to align cache semantics with user expectations under interruption/cancellation scenarios.

Uncertainties / risks: temporary `.part` naming is deterministic per VM/image path; concurrent downloads for the exact same VM config could still contend on that temp filename. Current behavior is still materially safer than direct-to-final writes.

Tradeoffs and what might break: one extra `mv` and cleanup call in the happy path; minimal overhead for improved integrity.

What I am confident about: added regression test (`test_fetch_image_uses_atomic_temp_then_move`) and VM helper tests + syntax checks pass.

## 2026-02-27 22:01:13 +0000

Addressed two issues from live usage. First, improved VM-create error handling when share mode is requested but host lacks `virtiofsd`: `aivm/vm/lifecycle.py` now detects that specific `virt-install` failure and raises a clearer actionable `RuntimeError` message instead of surfacing only the raw installer error chain. This applies to both normal and UEFI-fallback create attempts.

Second, expanded interactive `aivm config init` edit flow to include core VM hardware choices (`vm.user`, `vm.cpus`, `vm.ram_mb`, `vm.disk_gb`) and updated the default summary display to show those fields up front. Added integer-input validation for hardware fields.

State of mind / reflection: these are practical UX corrections directly informed by real runs. The virtiofsd issue is a host capability mismatch, so clarity matters more than silent retries; hardware controls in init reduce friction and prevent immediate post-init edits.

Uncertainties / risks: virtiofsd detection still relies on matching known `virt-install` error text; if upstream wording changes, enriched messaging could miss and fall back to raw error output.

Tradeoffs and what might break: init interaction now includes more prompts in edit mode; this is intentional for explicit control but slightly longer.

What I am confident about: targeted tests for both behaviors pass (`tests/test_vm_helpers.py`, `tests/test_cli_config_init.py`) and syntax checks are clean.

## 2026-02-27 22:06:11 +0000

Added hardware drift guidance for existing VM definitions after config edits. In `aivm/cli/vm.py`, `VMUpCLI` now checks live `virsh dominfo` vs configured `vm.cpus` / `vm.ram_mb` when bringing up an existing VM without `--recreate`. If drift is detected, it prints a non-destructive command recipe (`virsh setvcpus`, `setmaxmem`, `setmem`) and explicitly notes that these changes preserve disk/state.

State of mind / reflection: this closes an important UX gap where users could edit config expecting changes to apply, but existing domains remained unchanged silently. The goal was actionable clarity without taking risky implicit actions.

Uncertainties / risks: drift detection currently focuses on CPU and RAM only; other domain-definition changes still require manual judgment/recreate workflows. Parsing relies on `dominfo` output format but is simple and tested.

Tradeoffs and what might break: extra informational output appears on `vm up` when drift is present; this is intentional to prevent hidden mismatch confusion.

What I am confident about: added parser/drift tests in `tests/test_cli_status_helpers.py`, and related helper test suites pass.

## 2026-02-27 22:15:17 +0000

Completed a breaking state-model refactor to remove `vms.share` and consolidate share configuration into attachment records. Key changes: removed `ShareConfig` from `AgentVMConfig`; removed `[vms.share]` load/save handling in store serialization; bumped store schema default to `3`; updated share operations to take explicit attachment parameters (`source_dir`, `tag`, `guest_dst`) instead of reading from VM config fields; updated attached-session plumbing to carry share parameters in `PreparedSession` and persist them via `[[attachments]]` only.

State of mind / reflection: this was a high-surface-area cleanup but conceptually simplifying. The previous mixed model (VM-embedded share config + attachment table) caused drift and confusing ownership of share state. Unifying on attachments makes behavior easier to reason about and aligns with the intended workflow.

Uncertainties / risks: this intentionally drops backward compatibility for `vms.share` entries in existing config stores. Also, VM create paths now only include virtiofs mapping when share info is explicitly provided by attach/code/ssh flows, which changes behavior for users who previously relied on VM config embedded share defaults.

Tradeoffs and what might break: direct `vm up` no longer implicitly provisions share mappings because there is no share state in VM config. This is consistent with attachment-first design but may surprise old workflows.

What I am confident about: full test suite passes (`61 passed, 1 skipped`) after refactor, including CLI, store, detect, status, and VM helper coverage.

## 2026-02-27 22:24:45 +0000

Implemented the first structural refactor pass after share-model consolidation: introduced a unified attachment resolution layer in `aivm/cli/vm.py` (`ResolvedAttachment` + `_resolve_attachment`, `_align_attachment_tag_with_mappings`, `_attachment_has_mapping`) and rewired both `vm attach` and attached-session preparation (`code`/`ssh` path) to use it.

State of mind / reflection: this was a good seam to extract first because attachment tag/guest-destination derivation had started to drift between code paths. Centralizing those decisions reduces subtle behavior mismatches and makes follow-on VM reconcile refactor cleaner.

Uncertainties / risks: the resolver currently lives in `cli/vm.py` rather than a dedicated module, so ownership is clearer than before but still CLI-scoped. If reuse expands, moving to a shared attachment utility module may be warranted.

Tradeoffs and what might break: this touched hot paths for attach/code/ssh, so regression risk was non-trivial; mitigated by full-suite run.

What I am confident about: all tests pass (`61 passed, 1 skipped`) and compile checks are clean after the refactor.

## 2026-02-27 22:29:02 +0000

Completed the larger reconcile-layer refactor for attached VM workflows in `aivm/cli/vm.py`. Introduced explicit policy/result objects (`ReconcilePolicy`, `ReconcileResult`) and extracted the state transition engine into `_reconcile_attached_vm(...)`, which now centralizes optimistic probes + privileged reconciliation for network/firewall/vm/share in one place. `_prepare_attached_session(...)` is now primarily orchestration/wiring around resolver + reconcile + final SSH mount/setup.

State of mind / reflection: this is the right structural boundary for current code size. The previous giant function mixed attachment resolution, plan decisions, action execution, and final session return; splitting it gives a coherent reconcile API that can evolve into a dedicated module later if needed.

Uncertainties / risks: reconcile logic still lives in `cli/vm.py` and depends on local helper functions; if we later want cross-command reuse beyond attach/code/ssh, moving this into `aivm/vm/reconcile.py` with more formal dependency injection may be worthwhile.

Tradeoffs and what might break: there is some upfront abstraction overhead (extra dataclasses and call layers), but behavior remained unchanged and test coverage stayed green.

What I am confident about: full test suite passes (`61 passed, 1 skipped`) and compile checks pass; attach/code/ssh paths now share a clearer single reconciliation flow.

## 2026-02-28 02:27:26 +0000

Implemented configurable firewall port allowlists to permit selective VM access to host and blocked/private network services while keeping default isolation strict. Added `allow_tcp_ports` and `allow_udp_ports` to `FirewallConfig` in `aivm/config.py`, and wired them into nft rule generation in `aivm/firewall.py`.

Behavior: when allowlists are set, nft script now inserts explicit accept rules for those ports on bridge ingress in `input` (VM->host services) and before blocked-CIDR drops in `forward` (VM->private/LAN services on specified ports). Added port normalization/validation (dedupe + 1..65535 range) with clear runtime errors on invalid values.

State of mind / reflection: this fills a practical gap without weakening default stance. The key tradeoff was where to apply exceptions; applying both to host input and blocked-forward paths matches user intent (“host network or machine”) while preserving deny-by-default for everything else.

Uncertainties / risks: if users clear `block_cidrs` entirely, rule shape around blocked-CIDR clauses may become less meaningful; current behavior assumes normal non-empty block lists. Also, broad port allowlists can materially reduce isolation if misused.

What I am confident about: added firewall tests for allowlist rendering and invalid-port validation, updated README note, and full test suite passes (`63 passed, 1 skipped`).

## 2026-02-28 02:33:23 +0000

Added a new `aivm config lint` command to detect unknown/unused keys and sections in the config store TOML. Implemented linting in `aivm/cli/config.py` by parsing the raw TOML and validating top-level keys, `[[vms]]` record keys/section names, per-section field keys, and `[[attachments]]` keys. This now flags stale removed sections like `vms.share` explicitly.

State of mind / reflection: this complements recent breaking schema/model changes by giving users a direct way to discover stale config state instead of relying on silent ignore behavior.

Uncertainties / risks: lint currently focuses on structural key/section validity, not deep semantic validation (e.g., types/ranges for every field beyond TOML parsing and model-level usage).

Tradeoffs and what might break: `config lint` returns non-zero when issues are found, which is intentional and useful for CI/preflight checks.

What I am confident about: added focused lint tests (`tests/test_cli_config_lint.py`) and full suite remains green (`65 passed, 1 skipped`).

## 2026-02-28 15:12:44 +0000

Aligned docs/status wording with the new defaults-first flow where `aivm config init` sets baseline defaults and VM lifecycle is explicit via `aivm vm create` / `aivm vm destroy`. Updated `aivm/status.py` suggested next-step command from `vm up` to `vm create` when the VM is not defined, and adjusted the global status guidance line to call out init-then-create. Also updated README quickstart config-store flow to include `aivm vm create` immediately after `aivm config init`.

State of mind / reflection: this is a consistency pass, not new behavior, but it matters because users rely on status output as operational guidance. Inconsistent text would create friction right after the recent command model shift.

Uncertainties / risks: there may still be additional stale references in external docs (e.g., readthedocs pages not in this repo snapshot) that need the same wording update.

Tradeoffs and what might break: very low risk; the changes are user-facing messaging/docs only. The only behavioral impact is which command is suggested in status detail.

What I am confident about: changes are minimal and localized, and they align with the implemented CLI behavior already covered by existing tests.

## 2026-02-28 15:16:34 +0000

Updated `aivm vm destroy` to accept VM name as positional argument 1. Added `vm = scfg.Value('', position=1, ...)` to `VMDestroyCLI` and wired it through `_load_cfg_with_path(..., vm_opt=args.vm)` so explicit names bypass ambiguity and target the intended VM directly.

State of mind / reflection: this is a small but important CLI ergonomics fix; destroy should mirror create/attach style where a VM can be named inline without extra flags.

Uncertainties / risks: parser behavior for direct command-class unit invocation is quirky because `scriptconfig` reserves a special `--config` option in list-argv mode; tests should exercise the top-level modal parser path to reflect actual usage.

Tradeoffs and what might break: low risk change; omission of positional VM still retains prior resolution behavior via active/single VM selection.

What I am confident about: added parser-level test coverage in `tests/test_cli_vm_create.py` using `AgentVMModalCLI` invocation (`aivm vm destroy <name> ...`), and focused tests pass.

## 2026-02-28 15:27:34 +0000

Refactored store model to make networks first-class managed objects with VM references, without migration/back-compat handling. Added `Store.networks` and `NetworkEntry`, changed `VMEntry` to carry `network_name`, and updated serialization to persist `[[networks]]` + lean `[[vms]]` records (no embedded per-VM network/firewall sections). Added runtime materialization (`materialize_vm_cfg`) that resolves VM network/firewall by reference and fails clearly when a VM points to a missing network.

Wired CLI paths to the new model: `_load_cfg_with_path` now uses materialized VM config; VM record persistence now ensures referenced network is recorded; `vm create` auto-registers/uses network definitions from defaults; `host net` subcommands now resolve managed networks directly (even when no VMs exist), accept positional network name, and `host net destroy` guards against deleting in-use networks unless `--force` (guard skipped in dry-run).

State of mind / reflection: this is the right structural boundary to keep network lifecycle sane and independent. Treating network/firewall as shared resources avoids duplicated/conflicting per-VM settings and matches real libvirt semantics.

Uncertainties / risks: no migration means old stores with only per-VM network definitions will break until users reinitialize/recreate config in the new shape. That is intentional per current project direction.

Tradeoffs and what might break: stricter referential checks can surface errors earlier (missing network references), which is desirable but may feel abrupt. Force-destroying a network still allows creating dangling VM references; this remains a deliberate escape hatch.

What I am confident about: full suite passes after refactor (`68 passed, 1 skipped`), including updated lint/schema tests and dry-run command coverage.

## 2026-02-28 15:41:26 +0000

Added `aivm help raw` to print direct underlying system-tool commands that map to common `aivm` status/debug checks. Implemented in `aivm/cli/help.py` as `HelpRawCLI`, included in the help modal tree, and made it resolve VM/network/firewall targets from the config store when possible (active/specified/single VM heuristics), while still printing usable defaults when context is ambiguous.

State of mind / reflection: this is a practical transparency feature. Users can now inspect/debug with `virsh`/`nft`/`ssh` commands directly without reverse-engineering what `aivm` is doing under the hood.

Uncertainties / risks: command block currently assumes common defaults for some paths/users in the examples (e.g., image path root, SSH username) where exact values may differ; still useful as a mapping aid rather than exact execution transcript.

Tradeoffs and what might break: very low risk; this is additive command output. The new resolver logic in help is intentionally lightweight and non-authoritative.

What I am confident about: added tests for raw output and command tree inclusion (`tests/test_cli_helpers.py`, `tests/test_cli_dryrun.py`), and full suite passes (`69 passed, 1 skipped`).

## 2026-02-28 15:56:39 +0000

Added an interactive defaults-override review step to `aivm vm create` to mirror prior `config init` ergonomics, but scoped to VM creation time. `VMCreateCLI` now shows a summary and prompts `Use these values? [Y/e/n] (e=edit)` when `--yes` is not provided, allowing edits to VM identity/hardware and network settings before create/start.

State of mind / reflection: this aligns command intent with user workflow: `config init` sets baseline preferences; `vm create` is now where per-VM overrides are naturally applied.

Uncertainties / risks: if a user edits `network.name` to an existing managed network while also editing subnet fields, existing network definitions still take precedence by name. That behavior is consistent with first-class network ownership but may be surprising without explicit warning.

Tradeoffs and what might break: non-interactive runs still require `--yes`; now they also avoid the new review step. Interactive runs are one prompt longer by design.

What I am confident about: added tests for interactive edit and abort flows in `tests/test_cli_vm_create.py`; full suite remains green (`72 passed, 1 skipped`).

## 2026-02-28 17:59:44 +0000

Refactored VM resource sanity checks into a shared module (`aivm/resource_checks.py`) and reused it across both `vm create` and `config init` to reduce duplication. `vm create` continues to warn for “likely too high” resource requests and hard-fails for physically infeasible CPU/RAM requests. `config init` now emits the same warning class for baseline defaults so users see capacity concerns earlier while choosing defaults.

State of mind / reflection: this was a straightforward consolidation that also fixed UX timing: warnings now appear consistently from one source of truth in both workflows.

Uncertainties / risks: host-availability metrics (especially `MemAvailable`) are snapshot-based and can fluctuate quickly, so warnings/errors are best-effort guardrails rather than deterministic admission control.

Tradeoffs and what might break: moving checks into a shared module changed monkeypatch/test seams; tests were updated to patch shared check outputs instead of host-probe internals.

What I am confident about: added config-init coverage for shared resource warnings, updated vm-create tests, and full suite is green (`75 passed, 1 skipped`).

## 2026-02-28 18:05:45 +0000

Adjusted resource warning and VM-create error reporting based on real nested-VM behavior. RAM warnings now prioritize `MemTotal` (stable capacity signal) instead of warning on low transient `MemAvailable` snapshots that were producing false positives. Hard feasibility checks already use `MemTotal`/CPU only. Also changed `virt-install` UEFI-first attempt handling to avoid surfacing a noisy error log when UEFI is unavailable but non-UEFI fallback succeeds.

State of mind / reflection: this was a practical correction from production-like logs. The previous warning/error shape was technically derived from system metrics but not aligned with user expectations in constrained virtualized hosts.

Uncertainties / risks: disk-warning heuristics remain conservative and may still produce advisory warnings in sparse-image scenarios; keeping it warning-only avoids blocking.

Tradeoffs and what might break: first-attempt `virt-install` now uses non-throwing path and manually promotes failures, which slightly changes control flow but preserves explicit errors for real failures.

What I am confident about: added/updated tests in `tests/test_resource_checks.py` and verified VM helper fallback behavior; full suite passes (`78 passed, 1 skipped`).

## 2026-02-28 18:33:55 +0000

Applied `special_options=False` explicitly to all `cls.cli(...)` invocations in `aivm/cli/*` to avoid scriptconfig special-option interactions (notably around `--config`/short-flag parsing behavior). This keeps parsing behavior predictable and decoupled from scriptconfig’s special-option machinery while preserving existing command semantics.

State of mind / reflection: this is a targeted parser hardening change motivated by observed scriptconfig quirks. It’s low complexity and improves determinism.

Uncertainties / risks: if any command previously relied on special options implicitly (e.g., uncommon scriptconfig-level meta flags), those are now disabled by design.

Tradeoffs and what might break: help and normal subcommand parsing remain intact; only scriptconfig special-option paths are suppressed.

What I am confident about: full suite remains green after the change (`78 passed, 1 skipped`).

## 2026-02-28 18:47:12 +0000

Reversed the prior parser hard-disable and moved toward scriptconfig-native argument handling as requested. Removed `special_options=False` from all command `cls.cli(...)` calls, added `_BaseCommand.__post_init__` to centralize logging setup from parsed args/config context, and trimmed manual argv normalization to only legacy top-level/subcommand name aliases (kept `init`/`ls` and hyphenated subcommand names). Also made `host_src` positional in code/ssh/attach command definitions so scriptconfig handles those directly without argv rewriting.

State of mind / reflection: this is a cleaner architecture boundary: scriptconfig parses, commands consume normalized config, and `_BaseCommand` handles cross-cutting setup in one place.

Uncertainties / risks: a small amount of name-alias normalization remains in `main` for backward-compatible command spellings; if we want to go fully strict later, that shim can be removed in one step.

Tradeoffs and what might break: direct unit-style invocation patterns that depended on parser quirks may shift with special options re-enabled, but command behavior through `aivm ...` stays stable.

What I am confident about: test suite is fully green after this refactor (`78 passed, 1 skipped`).

## 2026-02-28 19:23:50 +0000

Completed the next parser cleanup pass: removed argv munging from `aivm.cli.main.main(...)` entirely and now pass argv directly to `AgentVMModalCLI.main(...)`. Also set `_BaseCommand.__special_options__ = False` so scriptconfig special-option behavior is consistently disabled via class configuration rather than per-call flags. Deleted old `_normalize_argv` and `_count_verbose` helpers and updated helper tests that imported those private functions.

State of mind / reflection: this is closer to the desired boundary where scriptconfig owns parsing behavior and aivm avoids maintaining a parallel argv rewrite layer.

Uncertainties / risks: dropping normalization removes compatibility shims for legacy aliases (`init`, `ls`, hyphenated subcommand forms). This is intentional based on current direction, but users/scripts depending on those aliases may need adjustment.

Tradeoffs and what might break: convenience alias behavior is the primary likely impact; core command parsing and execution remain intact.

What I am confident about: full suite passes after removal (`76 passed, 1 skipped`), including CLI command-path tests.

## 2026-02-28 21:19:38 +0000

Refactored command side effects out of `_BaseCommand.__post_init__` into an overridden `_BaseCommand.cli(...)` flow. The classmethod now calls `super().cli(...)`, resolves config-driven verbosity from parsed args, and then performs logging setup once per actual command parse path. Simplified global state by removing request-key caching and keeping only idempotent `_setup_logging` state guard keyed by effective `(level, colorize)`.

State of mind / reflection: this is a cleaner lifecycle boundary: parse first, then side effects based on parsed values. It avoids parser-construction churn from `__post_init__` while keeping config reads explicit and safe.

Uncertainties / risks: repeated command parses still perform config reads (intentional to avoid stale-config footguns), which leaves some overhead in dryrun aggregation tests.

Tradeoffs and what might break: moving logic into `cli` override depends on scriptconfig call ordering contracts; current tests confirm behavior but this is a coupling to monitor if scriptconfig internals change.

What I am confident about: full test suite remains green (`76 passed, 1 skipped`) and targeted dryrun test remains substantially improved over pre-optimization baseline.

## 2026-02-28 21:34:50 +0000

Implemented a focused UX safety warning in VM destroy flow: after `aivm vm destroy` removes the VM from the config store, the CLI now checks whether that VM's network still exists in the store but has zero VM users. If so, it emits a `log.warning` that the network is now unused and suggests the explicit cleanup command (`aivm host net destroy <name>`). I also added a unit test in `tests/test_cli_vm_create.py` that stubs destructive calls and asserts this warning is emitted for a single-VM/single-network case.

State of mind / reflection: this was a tight, low-risk change with clear behavioral intent from user feedback. The existing store helpers (`find_network`, `network_users`) made this straightforward and kept the implementation clean rather than adding custom bookkeeping.

Uncertainties / risks: this warning is store-driven, not live-libvirt-driven. If a user has out-of-band state changes, messaging may be slightly optimistic/pessimistic relative to actual libvirt network usage. Given current CLI semantics, that tradeoff is acceptable for a post-destroy hint.

Tradeoffs and what might break: warning volume can increase in workflows that intentionally keep persistent shared networks after deleting VMs; however this is only a warning and does not change behavior.

What I am confident about: targeted tests pass (`tests/test_cli_vm_create.py` and `tests/test_cli_helpers.py`), and the added logic runs only on non-dry-run destroy paths, preserving existing dry-run behavior.

## 2026-02-28 22:01:00 +0000

Fixed a regression in `aivm vm create` where libvirt network provisioning could be skipped before `virt-install`. The create flow already ensured a network record existed in config store, but that is not equivalent to ensuring the runtime libvirt network exists; this caused failures like `Network not found: no network with matching name 'aivm-net'` on fresh hosts/environments.

I updated `VMCreateCLI.main` to call `ensure_network(cfg, recreate=False, dry_run=...)` before VM creation, and to apply firewall rules when enabled (`apply_firewall(cfg, dry_run=...)`) in the same privileged block. Added a regression test (`test_vm_create_ensures_network_before_vm_create`) and adjusted existing VM-create tests to stub network/firewall side effects.

State of mind / reflection: this was a direct runtime-vs-config distinction bug. The fix keeps behavior aligned with user expectations for “create from scratch” while preserving dry-run semantics.

Uncertainties / risks: warning text from `virt-install` about low recommended RAM remains external/tool-level; we are not suppressing it, which is desirable for visibility.

Tradeoffs and what might break: VM create now always executes network/firewall setup paths (or dry-run logs), which is intended but increases touched subsystems during create.

What I am confident about: full suite is green (`78 passed, 1 skipped`), and the regression path is explicitly covered by unit tests.

## 2026-02-28 22:03:20 +0000

Fixed a share-reconciliation bug that could cause `aivm ssh .` to skip attaching a required share and then fail inside guest mount with `mount -t virtiofs ... wrong fs type`. Root cause: share discovery helpers (`vm_share_mappings`, `vm_has_share`) treated all libvirt `<filesystem>` devices as equivalent, including non-virtiofs entries (e.g., legacy 9p). That could falsely report "share already present" even when no virtiofs mapping existed for the requested tag.

I updated `aivm/vm/share.py` to only consider filesystem entries with `<driver type='virtiofs'/>`. Also updated `tests/test_vm_helpers.py` to include mixed filesystem drivers and assert non-virtiofs mappings are ignored.

State of mind / reflection: this was a clear semantic mismatch between "filesystem device exists" and "virtiofs share exists". Narrowing to virtiofs makes the detection logic honest and aligns with guest mount behavior.

Uncertainties / risks: if any environments define virtiofs without explicit driver nodes in domain XML, these mappings would now be ignored. Given aivm emits explicit virtiofs driver declarations, this is an acceptable constraint.

Tradeoffs and what might break: status/reporting may show fewer mappings where legacy non-virtiofs filesystems exist; this is intentional and prevents false positives in attach logic.

What I am confident about: full test suite passes (`78 passed, 1 skipped`) and the mixed-driver helper test now guards against regression.

## 2026-02-28 22:04:30 +0000

Handled a follow-up `aivm ssh .` attach failure where libvirt rejected live virtiofs attach with `unsupported configuration: 'virtiofs' requires shared memory`. This occurs when an existing VM definition lacks the required `<memoryBacking><source type='memfd'/><access mode='shared'/>` entries.

Implemented two changes:
1) Added `vm_has_virtiofs_shared_memory(...)` in `aivm/vm/share.py` to inspect domain XML for virtiofs-compatible shared-memory backing.
2) Updated attached-session reconcile flow (`aivm/cli/vm.py`) to pre-check this condition before attempting live attach and return a precise actionable error that points users to `--recreate_if_needed` (or manual recreate), rather than surfacing only the lower-level virsh attach failure.

Also added helper tests in `tests/test_vm_helpers.py` and kept prior virtiofs-only mapping filtering intact.

State of mind / reflection: this is a pragmatic guardrail. The raw virsh error is technically accurate but not enough at the CLI level; this change makes failure mode explicit in aivm terms.

Uncertainties / risks: we still rely on recreate semantics for repairing old VM definitions; if users expect non-recreate in-place conversion, that would need a separate redefine workflow.

Tradeoffs and what might break: none expected beyond earlier/cleaner failure in this specific mismatch case.

What I am confident about: full suite passes (`79 passed, 1 skipped`) and helper coverage now includes shared-memory detection.

## 2026-02-28 22:06:10 +0000

Changed VM creation defaults so every newly defined VM is created with shared memory backing (`--memorybacking source.type=memfd,access.mode=shared`) regardless of whether an initial share is attached during create. Previously this option was only added when `share_source_dir` was provided, which left many VMs unable to accept later virtiofs live-attach operations without recreate.

Implementation detail: in `aivm/vm/lifecycle.py`, `create_or_start_vm` now seeds `virt-install` args with memorybacking by default and only appends `--filesystem ... driver.type=virtiofs` conditionally when share params are provided.

Tests: updated `tests/test_vm_helpers.py` (`test_create_vm_fallback_when_uefi_firmware_missing`) to assert both initial and UEFI-fallback `virt-install` calls include `--memorybacking`.

State of mind / reflection: this aligns command defaults with the common workflow (`vm create` first, attach later) and removes an avoidable trap.

Uncertainties / risks: hosts lacking memfd/shared support could fail earlier at create-time; in supported libvirt/qemu setups this is expected to work and is required for virtiofs.

Tradeoffs and what might break: if someone intentionally wanted a VM definition without shared memory backing, that is no longer default behavior.

What I am confident about: full test suite passes (`79 passed, 1 skipped`) and the regression path is now guarded.
## 2026-03-02 17:22:51 +0000
Worked on `aivm vm attach` behavior for running VMs. The command previously ensured libvirt had the virtiofs mapping (including live attach when running) but did not proactively mount the share inside the guest at attach time. I updated `aivm/cli/vm.py` so attach now detects running state, resolves SSH/IP when needed, and calls `ensure_share_mounted(...)` after recording the attachment. This makes a direct `aivm attach .` immediately usable in a running VM without requiring a follow-up `ssh` / `code` command.

State of mind / reflection: this was a small but high-impact UX consistency gap; the system already had the right building blocks in code/ssh flows, so the pragmatic move was reusing those paths in attach rather than adding new mechanics. I focused on keeping behavior explicit and predictable rather than adding more flags.

Uncertainties / risks: attach on a running VM can now block/fail on IP/SSH discovery if guest networking is unhealthy, where previously attach mostly stayed host-side. This is intentional for immediate exposure semantics, but could surprise scripts that relied on attach succeeding even when guest SSH is unavailable.

Tradeoffs and what might break: we traded faster “record-only” completion for stronger guarantee that the guest mount is actually present when VM is running. In degraded network states this may produce a failure after libvirt attach/store updates have already happened; that partial-success profile is similar to other multi-step CLI operations but still worth watching.

What I am confident about: targeted tests cover both new branches (running VM mounts, stopped VM skips guest mount), and related helper tests still pass under `uv run --active` with pytest plugin autoload disabled and addopts overridden for this environment.
## 2026-03-02 17:29:01 +0000
Follow-up fix for `aivm attach` after a real-world failure trace where the VM was running but attach only updated config. Root cause was a false negative from `vm_exists()` in `VMAttachCLI`: it executes `virsh dominfo` via non-interactive sudo (`sudo -n`), so without an existing sudo ticket it returned nonzero and the flow silently skipped libvirt attach and guest mount.

I refactored attach VM-state resolution in `aivm/cli/vm.py` to avoid that blind spot: probe VM state without sudo first, and if that probe is inconclusive/undefined, explicitly run `_confirm_sudo_block(...)` and re-probe with sudo before deciding whether to attach/mount. Once VM is known defined, attach still confirms privileged ops and proceeds with mapping checks/attach. Added a user-facing line when VM is defined but not running to make mount expectations explicit.

State of mind / reflection: this was a correctness-over-convenience fix. The prior behavior looked successful from CLI output while doing less than intended, which is a bad UX failure mode. The goal here was to make failure/permission boundaries explicit and deterministic.

Uncertainties / risks: attach now prompts for sudo in more cases (specifically when non-sudo probe cannot establish VM state), which may feel noisier for some setups. This is acceptable because privileged checks/operations are genuinely required to guarantee live attach behavior.

What I am confident about: regression coverage now includes the exact sudo-inconclusive path, plus running/stopped behavior. Targeted tests and syntax checks passed in this environment.
## 2026-03-02 22:51:25 +0000
Implemented a new `aivm vm update` command to reconcile config drift against the live libvirt VM definition with explicit operator confirmation behavior. The command now compares configured CPU, RAM, and disk size against libvirt/qemu state, prints a concrete update plan, applies non-destructive updates (`virsh setvcpus`, `virsh setmaxmem/setmem`, `qemu-img resize` for growth), and handles restart policy with `--restart={auto,always,never}`. For running VMs, CPU/RAM changes are persisted and the command can prompt/reboot so changes take effect immediately.

State of mind / reflection: this felt like closing a known usability loop where drift was already detectable but not actionable. I kept scope focused on high-value mutable settings (disk/cpu/ram) and intentionally avoided broad “best effort” mutation of fragile areas (network rebinding), because silent or partial behavior there is risky.

Uncertainties / risks: libvirt host environments vary; `virsh reboot` may fail on some guest setups without ACPI reboot support. In that case the command currently surfaces the error and leaves the persisted updates intact, requiring manual restart. Disk shrink is intentionally rejected as unsafe in-place.

Tradeoffs and what might break: update flow currently requires sudo-backed introspection and applies only the supported mutable settings. Network drift is reported diagnostically but not auto-remediated. That is a deliberate safety tradeoff to avoid hidden topology changes.

What I am confident about: added unit coverage for new parsing helpers and update command behavior, and full suite passed locally (`87 passed, 2 skipped`). Docs/help were updated to expose `aivm vm update` in quickstart and `help plan` flow.
## 2026-03-02 23:01:12 +0000
Fixed a `vm update` privilege-escalation gap reported from real usage. Initial implementation only escalated to sudo when `dominfo` failed, but some hosts allow non-sudo `dominfo/domstate` while requiring sudo for `dumpxml` and `qemu-img info` (disk path/size inspection). In that case disk drift could be skipped and the command could incorrectly say the VM was in sync.

I updated `aivm/cli/vm.py` so `_vm_update_drift` now probes disk/XML with non-sudo first, then explicitly prompts via `_confirm_sudo_block(...)` and retries with sudo when needed. This preserves safe default behavior while correctly discovering disk drift for users without passwordless sudo. Added regression test `test_vm_update_drift_escalates_for_disk_probe` in `tests/test_cli_vm_update.py` to lock in this flow.

State of mind / reflection: this is exactly the kind of split-permission runtime detail that unit mocks often miss unless forced. The user trace made root cause unambiguous.

Uncertainties / risks: command still depends on interactive confirmation unless `--yes`; non-interactive callers without `--yes` will intentionally fail before privileged probes.

What I am confident about: targeted tests and full suite pass (`88 passed, 2 skipped`).
## 2026-03-02 23:40:28 +0000
Addressed a batch of UX/runtime issues surfaced from hands-on feedback.

1) `vm update` running-VM disk drift:
`qemu-img info` can fail against active qcow2 images due to shared write lock. I updated drift detection to catch that failure mode and fall back to `virsh domblkinfo` capacity so disk drift can still be computed without requiring VM shutdown.

2) Missing host deps flow:
Added preflight dependency checks in VM bring-up paths (`vm create`, `vm up`, and attach/code/ssh reconcile start/create path). When required tools are missing, the CLI now prints the missing commands and offers an interactive install prompt (`aivm host install_deps` path) on Debian-like hosts. `--yes` now skips this interactive prompt and continues, so scripted/non-interactive behavior remains predictable.

3) Command visibility logging:
Adjusted command logging in `run_cmd(...)` so setup/mutating commands (`check=True`) are logged at INFO as explicit `RUN: ...` lines; probe/query commands (`check=False`) remain DEBUG-level. This makes setup intent visible at normal verbosity while keeping introspection noise lower.

4) SSH config update consistency:
`aivm ssh .` now updates the managed SSH config block (same as `aivm code .`) before launching SSH, and reports when the entry changed.

5) One-step bootstrap from ssh/code:
When `aivm ssh .` / `aivm code .` is invoked with no managed VMs configured, the flow now prompts to run config init + VM create automatically (or performs it directly with `--yes`), then retries resolution.

State of mind / reflection: this set was about reducing friction in first-run and drift-reconciliation workflows without widening safety blast radius. The tradeoff was introducing more branchy control flow around bootstrap and privilege escalation; tests were added for each new path to keep it manageable.

Uncertainties / risks: static IP/hostname stability in generated SSH config remains unresolved; current updates improve freshness/automation but do not yet provide deterministic guest addressing.

What I am confident about: targeted tests plus full suite passed (`90 passed, 2 skipped`).
## 2026-03-02 23:47:16 +0000
Implemented command-preview UX for privileged blocks so users see concrete commands before sudo validation/prompting.

Changes:
- Extended `_confirm_sudo_block(...)` to accept `preview_cmds` and print them first.
- Reordered behavior so preview output appears before any sudo capability checks (`sudo -n true`) or interactive approval prompts.
- Wired previews into major privileged callsites across VM, network, firewall, host, and apply flows (create/start/update/status/wait_ip/destroy and related attach/code/ssh reconcile paths).

State of mind / reflection: this makes the CLI’s intent legible at the exact decision point users care about (before privilege escalation). It also aligns better with “show me the actual command” feedback rather than abstract operation labels.

Uncertainties / risks: some previews are representative templates (e.g., generated XML/ruleset files) rather than literal final argv for every internal sub-step. The concrete runtime `RUN:` logs still provide exact executed commands once approved.

What I am confident about: behavior is now materially improved for trust/transparency, and full suite remains green (`90 passed, 2 skipped`).
## 2026-03-03 01:11:14 +0000
Implemented deferred sudo preflight/confirmation via intent arming so the prompt occurs at the first real `sudo` command execution point and can show that exact next command.

Technical changes:
- Added `SudoIntent` + contextvar state in `aivm/util.py` (`arm_sudo_intent`, consume-on-use flow).
- Moved sudo preflight/prompt behavior into `run_cmd(..., sudo=True)` when an intent is armed.
- First sudo command now previews:
  - `sudo -n true`
  - any high-level preview lines
  - the exact immediate command about to run
- Kept session-level sudo cache in util (`_SUDO_VALIDATED`) so repeated privileged calls do not reprompt.
- Simplified `aivm/cli/_common.py::_confirm_sudo_block` to arm intent only.

State of mind / reflection: this addressed the UX gap around “show me what you are actually about to run” without requiring fragile duplicated command strings at every callsite. The tradeoff is a little more stateful behavior in `run_cmd`, but it remains opt-in (only when a CLI flow arms intent).

Uncertainties / risks: if a privileged path forgets to call `_confirm_sudo_block`, it will still execute via old sudo behavior (no intent preview/prompt context). Existing policy already expects callsites to declare privileged boundaries.

What I am confident about: full suite passes (`92 passed, 2 skipped`) and targeted tests now cover intent-armed sudo flows.
## 2026-03-03 01:20:09 +0000
Follow-up refinement to sudo-preview UX to eliminate drift-prone duplicated command previews. The intent path now ignores callsite `preview_cmds` and always renders the immediate privileged command directly from `run_cmd` at execution time, alongside `sudo -n true`. This guarantees preview accuracy without maintaining command strings in two places.

I kept the arming model via `_confirm_sudo_block` and one-shot consumption at first sudo call so the displayed “next command” is exact and deterministic. Added `clear_sudo_intent()` helper and used it in util tests to avoid stale-intent leakage across test process state.

State of mind / reflection: this better matches the user’s concern about command drift while preserving explicit CLI privilege boundaries.

What I am confident about: test suite remains green (`92 passed, 2 skipped`).
## 2026-03-03 01:24:36 +0000
Adjusted sudo UX to remove `sudo -n true` preflight entirely. Privilege confirmation now happens only at the first actual privileged command execution point, and preview output shows only that real command (no synthetic probe command).

Implementation notes:
- `run_cmd(..., sudo=True)` now uses `sudo <cmd>` when stdin is interactive, allowing native sudo password prompt on the real command.
- Non-interactive mode still uses `sudo -n <cmd>` for fail-fast behavior.
- Intent-armed confirmation (`_confirm_sudo_block`) remains as the yes/no gate; with `yes=False` it prompts before each intent-scoped sudo command.
- Added intent reset at CLI parse entry (`clear_sudo_intent()`) to prevent stale intent leakage.

State of mind / reflection: this directly aligns behavior with user expectation that logs and prompt context should map to the real command, not a probe.

What I am confident about: full suite remains green (`92 passed, 2 skipped`).
## 2026-03-03 01:36:40 +0000
Refined privilege UX and policy defaults per feedback.

1) Removed duplicated preview surface:
- Eliminated `preview_cmds` usage entirely from callsites and sudo intent APIs.
- Preview now always comes from the exact immediate sudo command in `run_cmd`, preventing drift.

2) Removed synthetic sudo probe command:
- No `sudo -n true` preflight in interactive flows.
- With an armed sudo intent, confirmation occurs at the first real sudo command.
- Interactive execution now uses `sudo <cmd>` so sudo prompt/log context aligns with that command.
- Non-interactive execution still uses `sudo -n <cmd>` for fail-fast behavior.

3) Added configurable sudo-approval defaults:
- New config section: `[behavior]` with `yes_sudo` (default false).
- New CLI option on base command: `--yes-sudo`.
- `--yes` implies `--yes-sudo`.
- Effective sudo-approval policy now resolves from (CLI flags OR config defaults).

4) Context hygiene:
- Clear sudo intent at CLI parse start to avoid stale intent leakage between commands.

Also updated config/store/lint serialization paths to include `behavior` and added tests for roundtrip and CLI default resolution.

Validation: full suite green (`94 passed, 2 skipped`).
## 2026-03-03 14:46:27 +0000
Removed top-level `aivm apply` as requested to reduce CLI surface area and overlap with modern one-step flows (`aivm code .` / `aivm ssh .`) and explicit subcommands.

Changes made:
- Deleted `ApplyCLI` implementation from `aivm/cli/main.py`.
- Removed `apply = ApplyCLI` from `AgentVMModalCLI` command wiring.
- Updated README quickstart to remove `aivm apply --interactive` from the primary config-store flow.

State of mind / reflection: this is a straightforward simplification with low operational risk because the underlying granular commands remain available and one-step auto-reconcile flows are now the intended user path.

Uncertainties / risks: existing user scripts invoking `aivm apply` will now fail and must be migrated to explicit command sequences or `aivm code/ssh` workflows.

What I am confident about: command tree no longer includes `aivm apply`, and full suite remains green (`94 passed, 2 skipped`).
## 2026-03-03 14:53:21 +0000
Moved sudo-behavior policy to a true top-level store section, as requested.

Changes:
- `yes_sudo` now lives in top-level `[behavior]` on the config store, not under VM/default sections.
- Store model now has `Store.behavior` and serialization emits:
  - `[behavior]`
  - `yes_sudo = <bool>`
- Removed per-VM/default behavior serialization (`[vms.behavior]` / `[defaults.behavior]`) from save paths.
- Updated CLI policy resolution to read `reg.behavior.yes_sudo` as the default for `--yes-sudo`.
- Updated config lint rules to validate top-level `behavior` and stop treating VM/default `behavior` as first-class.

Compatibility:
- Added legacy read fallback: if top-level `[behavior]` is absent, loader can still infer `yes_sudo` from old `defaults.behavior` / `vms.behavior` records and surface it in `Store.behavior`.

Validation: full suite passes (`96 passed, 2 skipped`).
## 2026-03-03 15:11:27 +0000
Cleanup pass to reduce wrapper noise in `aivm/cli/vm.py` by removing one-hop private helpers that mostly forwarded to `aivm.status.probe_*` functions and inlining those probe calls at use sites.

What I worked on:
- Removed wrapper/helper functions that were trivial indirections (`_check_network`, `_check_firewall`, `_check_vm_state`, `_check_ssh_ready`, `_check_provisioned`, `_select_cfg_for_vm_name`, and an unused `_file_exists`).
- Updated callsites to directly consume `ProbeOutcome` from `probe_network`, `probe_firewall`, `probe_vm_state`, and `probe_ssh_ready`.
- Inlined VM resource warning/impossible checks into `VMCreateCLI.main` by removing two single-use private helpers.
- Repaired tests that referenced removed wrapper names by monkeypatching/testing `probe_*` APIs directly.

State of mind / reflection: this is the right direction for traceback clarity and maintenance cost. Each removed wrapper had become an extra frame with minimal semantic value, and keeping the logic at the callsite made control flow easier to read.

Uncertainties / risks: any external/private test harnesses relying on removed private symbols will break (internal suite was updated). There is still room for further cleanup, but aggressive inlining everywhere would risk reducing readability in more complex paths.

Tradeoffs: fewer helper boundaries can make long methods denser, but here the net effect is positive because the wrappers were almost pure passthroughs.

What might break: monkeypatch targets using old private function names.

What I am confident about: behavior parity is preserved; targeted tests and full suite pass (`96 passed, 2 skipped`).
## 2026-03-03 15:27:06 +0000
Implemented two cleanup/UX fixes requested by the user:

1) INFO logs for file writes
- Added explicit INFO log lines immediately before every direct runtime `write_text(...)` in `aivm` code:
  - config store writes (`aivm/store.py`)
  - single VM config writes (`aivm/config.py`)
  - SSH config entry updates (`aivm/cli/vm.py`)
  - VM IP cache writes (`aivm/vm/lifecycle.py`)
- This gives a consistent operator-visible audit trail of local file mutations.

2) Top-level behavior verbosity defaults
- Extended top-level behavior config with `verbose` and wired it into CLI logging default resolution.
- Root cause was that `_resolve_cfg_verbosity` only considered active/default VM verbosity and ignored `[behavior]` entirely.
- Added serialization and lint support for `[behavior].verbose`.

Tradeoff and precedence decision:
- To preserve old semantics for configs that never set behavior verbosity, I made behavior verbosity override only when it is non-default (`!= 1`).
- If behavior verbose is left at default 1, prior fallback still works (active VM verbosity, then defaults verbosity).
- If behavior verbose is explicitly set to another value (e.g., 100), it now controls CLI logging as intended.

State of mind / reflection: this was a targeted correction that improved predictability without broad refactors. I intentionally avoided introducing a larger logging abstraction and instead instrumented concrete write sites to keep behavior obvious.

Risks/uncertainties: some users might expect behavior verbose=1 to force INFO and suppress VM/default verbosity; current logic treats 1 as neutral to preserve compatibility with prior VM-scoped verbosity behavior.

Confidence: high; targeted tests and full suite passed (`97 passed, 2 skipped`).
## 2026-03-03 15:16:58 +0000
Fixed `ty check aivm` failure caused by strict attribute resolution on `scriptconfig` parsed objects.

What changed:
- In `aivm/cli/_common.py`, replaced direct assignment `parsed.yes_sudo = ...` with:
  - compute `effective_yes_sudo`
  - `setattr(parsed, 'yes_sudo', effective_yes_sudo)`
  - set context var from the local computed value.

Rationale: `ty` sees `parsed` as a generic `Config` and flags direct assignment to undeclared attributes. Using `setattr` preserves runtime behavior and avoids type-level unresolved-attribute diagnostics.

State of mind / reflection: very narrow compatibility fix; minimal change with clear semantics.

Confidence: high; `ty check aivm` passes and full tests remain green (`97 passed, 2 skipped`).
## 2026-03-03 15:46:24 +0000
Audited the repository for TODO/FIXME comment markers and reviewed each hit in context to propose concrete remediation paths.

What I worked on:
- Enumerated all TODO/FIXME markers across runtime code, CLI UX paths, docs tooling, CI workflow, and legacy dev scripts.
- Focused technical review on actionable production paths (`aivm/host.py`, `aivm/vm/lifecycle.py`, `aivm/cli/vm.py`) and separated low-risk docs/developer-script debt from end-user behavior issues.
- Prepared a prioritized set of changes emphasizing dependency-install robustness, user-facing error quality, and post-SSH messaging correctness.

State of mind / reflection: this was primarily a triage/risk-ranking pass rather than implementation. The important part was distinguishing comments that are stale/disabled code from TODOs attached to live flows users hit frequently.

Uncertainties / risks: docs `conf.py` contains multiple disabled or hacky branches that may be historical carryovers; changing them without docs-build coverage could introduce subtle Sphinx regressions. Legacy release/secrets scripts may no longer be operationally critical but still present maintenance drag.

Tradeoffs: prioritizing runtime/CLI TODOs first gives immediate UX and reliability benefits, while deferring documentation tooling cleanup avoids broad, low-signal churn.

What might break: tightening dependency-install behavior (lock retries, distro branching) can alter host setup timing and failure modes; post-SSH message changes may affect tests that assert exact CLI stdout.

What I am confident about: the TODO/FIXME inventory is complete for comment markers and the highest-impact fixes are concentrated in a small set of runtime files.
## 2026-03-03 15:50:05 +0000
Implemented the easy TODO/FIXME fixes limited to the `aivm` module runtime code, per user request.

What I worked on:
- `aivm/vm/lifecycle.py`
  - Replaced the cloud-init heredoc string TODO with `textwrap.dedent` formatting for `passwd_block`, `cloud`, `meta`, and `netcfg` blocks.
  - Implemented the prereq-error TODO around cloud-init generation: when command-missing conditions are detected (`FileNotFoundError`, exit 127, or "command not found"), `create_or_start_vm` now raises a clear `RuntimeError` directing users to run `aivm host install_deps`.
- `aivm/cli/vm.py`
  - Replaced TODO about traceback visibility by logging session-prep errors with trace-level exception context (`log.opt(exception=True).trace(...)`) while preserving user-facing concise error output.
  - Fixed VM SSH post-session messaging FIXME by handling ssh exit code explicitly (`check=False`) and only printing a success-end message when exit code is zero; non-zero now logs and returns failure code.

State of mind / reflection: these were small, contained improvements with high signal-to-risk. I avoided touching `aivm/host.py` TODOs because they involve broader installer policy and distro support decisions.

Uncertainties / risks: cloud-init text refactor preserves semantics but any whitespace-sensitive downstream parser expectations could surface; current tests passed. SSH CLI now returns the underlying ssh exit code rather than raising via `CmdError`, which is behaviorally cleaner but could affect callers relying on prior exception behavior.

What I am confident about: TODO/FIXME markers in active `aivm` runtime files (except host installer TODOs) are resolved, and targeted tests pass.

Validation:
- `python -m py_compile aivm/*.py aivm/cli/*.py aivm/vm/*.py`
- `pytest -q tests/test_vm_helpers.py tests/test_cli_helpers.py tests/test_cli_dryrun.py tests/test_cli_vm_update.py` -> `32 passed`
## 2026-03-03 15:58:43 +0000
Worked on security documentation aligned to the user’s primary threat model (malicious code inside VM; trusted host user/operator). Added a dedicated document at `docs/source/security.rst` and linked it from docs index and README notes.

What I focused on:
- Framed threat model boundaries explicitly (in-scope/out-of-scope).
- Documented trust boundaries for host, guest, shared folders, and network.
- Clarified SSH key handling scope (path usage + public key injection only, no private key copy intent).
- Added host package installation risk framing and rationale.
- Added design decision tradeoff table with explicit UX consequences, including cases that degrade convenience versus cases that break core workflows.
- Added a final section with practical hardening steps expected to improve security without major UX loss.

State of mind / reflection: I optimized for clarity and operator decision support rather than “security marketing.” The user asked for a model that justifies confidence, so the writeup explicitly calls out what protections do not cover, especially hypervisor escape class risk.

Uncertainties / risks: some statements are policy/intent-level and should stay synchronized with implementation as code evolves (for example firewall fail-closed behavior and attachment guardrails if/when implemented). There is a risk of doc drift unless kept as part of release review.

Tradeoffs: I intentionally kept this document at architecture/policy level and did not embed many implementation details to reduce churn, but that also means fewer direct code anchors for auditors.

What might break: only documentation and docs navigation changed; no runtime behavior changes.

What I am confident about: the document now captures the requested threat model and explicitly frames accepted risks versus UX cost of stronger controls.
## 2026-03-03 15:52:58 +0000
Addressed a follow-up formatting concern in cloud-init template generation (`aivm/vm/lifecycle.py`).

What changed:
- The risk was not the backslash continuation marker itself, but `dedent` behavior when interpolating a zero-indentation multiline block (`passwd_block`) into a dedented outer template.
- Fixed by pre-indenting the generated `passwd_block` to match the outer template indentation before interpolation.
- Kept the `f"""\` style (which is intentional for suppressing a leading blank line) and moved `{passwd_block}` to column 0 in the source template to avoid unintended mixed indentation outcomes.

Validation:
- `pytest -q tests/test_vm_helpers.py tests/test_cli_vm_update.py` -> `16 passed`.
## 2026-03-03 16:10:51 +0000
Fixed CI packaging-doc rendering issue in README long description.

What I worked on:
- Located `long_description` source via `pyproject.toml` (`readme = "README.rst"`).
- Found malformed RST near reported failure line: a `.. code-block:: toml` section ended and was immediately followed by normal paragraph text with no blank separator.
- Added the required blank line after the TOML snippet in `README.rst` (around line 93), which resolves the docutils warning `Explicit markup ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent`.

State of mind / reflection: this was a surgical fix tied directly to CI output; best to avoid broader README rewrites when the parser warning points to a specific structural issue.

Uncertainties / risks: local environment lacks packaging/render dependencies (`wheel`, `docutils`), so I could not execute full `python -m build` + `twine check` verification here; however, the specific parser rule violation is corrected.

What I am confident about: the RST structure at the failing location is now valid (explicit markup block separated from following paragraph by a blank line).
## 2026-03-03 16:03:48 +0000
Refined `docs/source/security.rst` based on feedback that the tail of the document mixed current guarantees with aspirational hardening advice.

What changed:
- Replaced the old "Design decisions and recommended hardening options" + operational profiles block with:
  - `Current design posture` (describes what is true today), and
  - `Future Security Work` (explicitly prospective; not guaranteed current behavior).
- Rewrote the operator checklist to a current practical baseline that avoids implying unsupported profile toggles are available today.

State of mind / reflection: the goal was to avoid overpromising capabilities while preserving useful direction. The previous language risked being interpreted as implemented controls.

Risks/uncertainties: this remains a narrative policy doc; if security features land, sections should be updated to move items from “future work” into “current behavior” with concrete links/config names.

Confidence: high that the document now better separates present-state security posture from roadmap-level ideas.
## 2026-03-03 16:38:09 +0000
Refactored `README.rst` for readability while preserving required top elements (badges + top-level links table).

What changed:
- Reorganized content into a clearer flow: what it provides, install, fast start, status/sudo behavior, common workflows, command groups, and safety notes.
- Reduced repetitive prose and grouped commands by user intent.
- Kept security model link visible in both warning and safety notes.
- Corrected an accidental code-block language mismatch (`ssh_config` snippet now marked as bash).

State of mind / reflection: aimed for practical onboarding clarity without deleting important operational caveats.

Risks/uncertainties: README restructuring can still omit niche details some power users expect; deeper lifecycle corner-cases may still belong in docs rather than README.

Confidence: high that the README now scans better for first-time users while preserving key safety and workflow information.
## 2026-03-03 17:40:52 +0000
Documentation-context pass in core code paths to improve maintainability for human/agent readers without changing behavior.

What I changed:
- Expanded key module/function docstrings in orchestration-heavy files:
  - `aivm/util.py`: clarified that `run_cmd` is the policy center for command logging and sudo intent semantics.
  - `aivm/cli/_common.py`: documented VM resolution precedence and folder-flow config resolution intent.
  - `aivm/cli/vm.py`: documented host dependency gating, VM update drift strategy, attach-session reconciliation role, and session bootstrap behavior.
  - `aivm/vm/lifecycle.py`: expanded module-level context and added lifecycle summary docstrings for cloud-init generation and create/start behavior.
  - `aivm/store.py`: documented effective-config materialization via VM/network join.
- Added one targeted inline comment in sudo intent plumbing explaining why intent is not consumed one-shot.

Reflection: focused on "why" and control-flow intent at points where function names alone do not reveal design constraints. Avoided dense inline commentary that would age poorly.

Risk/tradeoff: more docstring prose can drift if behavior changes; chosen comments are at stable orchestration boundaries to minimize churn.

Confidence: high; this was non-functional and validated by `ty check aivm` plus full tests (`97 passed, 2 skipped`).
## 2026-03-03 19:08:22 +0000
Performed requested staged documentation pass: deep context updates first in `status.py` and `cli/config.py`, then a broader repo-wide module-docstring sweep.

Deep pass details:
- `aivm/status.py`: expanded module context, documented tri-state `ProbeOutcome`, and added intent docstrings for probe/render functions.
- `aivm/cli/config.py`: expanded module context and documented interactive init review, discover/import behavior, lint scope, and discovery summary helpers.

Repo-wide pass details:
- Expanded terse module docstrings in core modules (`config`, `detect`, `firewall`, `host`, `net`, `resource_checks`, `runtime`, `store`) and CLI/VM wrappers (`cli/main`, `cli/help`, `cli/host`, `cli/net`, `cli/firewall`, `vm/share`, `vm/sync`).
- Added targeted orchestration docstrings/comments in `util`, `cli/_common`, `cli/vm`, and `vm/lifecycle` to capture design intent and non-obvious flow decisions.

Reflection: I prioritized comments that communicate control-flow intent, policy boundaries, and tradeoffs rather than narrating obvious code mechanics.

Risk/tradeoff: additional prose can drift as behavior evolves; I kept commentary centered on stable boundaries (resolution precedence, probe semantics, orchestration pivots) to reduce churn.

Validation: `ty check aivm` passed; full tests passed (`97 passed, 2 skipped`).

## 2026-03-03 20:11:53 +0000

Worked on a regression where attaching an already-owned host folder to a second VM could mutate VM/share state before the ownership conflict was surfaced. The key fix was to move conflict detection earlier in execution: I added `_ensure_attachment_not_owned_by_other_vm()` in `aivm/cli/vm.py` and called it in both `VMAttachCLI.main` and `_prepare_attached_session` before `_resolve_attachment` / `_reconcile_attached_vm` side effects.

State of mind / reflection: this felt like a safety-boundary ordering bug rather than a data-model bug. I focused on minimizing blast radius by preserving existing store semantics (`upsert_attachment` still enforces force/no-force) while making operational behavior match user expectations: if conflict exists and no `--force`, nothing in libvirt/VM state should be touched.

Uncertainties / risks: this does not change `--force` semantics; force reassignment can still intentionally move store ownership for a folder, which may alter folder-centric VM resolution for later `aivm code .` calls. I did not add automatic detach from the previous VM domain on force because that is a policy decision with potential surprise and broader lifecycle implications.

Tradeoffs and what might break: we now fail earlier in more paths, so callers that implicitly relied on late failures after partial reconcile will see earlier RuntimeError exits. That is intentional and should reduce accidental host-path exposure. If any external tooling expected those side effects before failure, behavior changes.

What I am confident about: regression tests now cover fail-fast ordering in `tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py` and `tests/test_cli_vm_update.py`; both ensure conflict abort happens before reconcile/mutation calls. `python3 -m py_compile` passes for touched modules.

## 2026-03-03 20:22:15 +0000

Shifted attachment policy from single-owner to multi-owner for shared host folders. Core change was in `aivm/store.py`: `upsert_attachment()` no longer rejects/rewrites when another VM already uses the same `host_path`; uniqueness is now only `(host_path, vm_name)`. Added helpers `find_attachments()` and `find_attachment_for_vm()` so call sites can choose explicit semantics instead of relying on a single implicit owner.

Reflection/state of mind: this was a policy simplification with a resolver complexity tradeoff. Removing the hard block is straightforward at storage layer, but folder-oriented VM selection needed an explicit strategy for ambiguous mappings. I chose deterministic behavior: attached-folder resolution prefers an attached active VM, otherwise prompts interactively, and errors in non-interactive mode unless `--vm` is provided.

Uncertainties/risks: folder-centric commands (`aivm code .` / `aivm ssh .`) now have ambiguity paths that can fail where old policy previously avoided ambiguity by prohibition. That is expected, but users/scripts may need to pass `--vm` more often when one folder is intentionally shared across VMs.

Tradeoffs and what might break: kept CLI `--force` flags in attach/code/ssh for now but marked as deprecated no-op text to avoid abrupt argument removal in this pass. If full cleanup is desired, removing those flags is a follow-up. `find_attachment()` remains for compatibility but now returns a deterministic first match from the attachment set; newer code should prefer explicit helpers.

What I am confident about: compile checks pass for all touched modules; tests were updated to assert multi-attach behavior and resolver ambiguity handling (`tests/test_store.py`, `tests/test_cli_helpers.py`), and stale conflict-based tests were removed from attach/update suites.

Implemented VM-create default-selection policy so creating a new VM no longer silently changes `active_vm`. In `aivm/cli/vm.py`, `VMCreateCLI` now has `--set_default` (opt-in). Post-create persistence now snapshots previous active VM, upserts the created VM, and only keeps it active when explicitly requested (`--set_default`) or when interactive prompt confirms; otherwise active VM is restored.

Reflection/state of mind: this was a targeted behavior fix with minimal model churn. I intentionally avoided changing store-level `upsert_vm_with_network()` semantics globally because many command paths rely on it; instead I scoped policy enforcement to `vm create` where user intent is clear and requested.

Uncertainties/risks: there is now one more interactive prompt path in `vm create` when not using `--yes` and not using `--set_default`; scripting should continue to pass `--yes` and now gets deterministic “default=no” behavior. If later we want the same policy for other workflows (discover/import/update), we should unify on a shared active-vm policy helper.

Tradeoffs and what might break: introducing `--set_default` changes expectations for users who were implicitly relying on created VMs becoming active. This is intentional per new policy request. I left the prompt default as No to keep non-accidental default switching.

What I am confident about: compile checks pass for touched modules, and tests now cover three cases in `tests/test_cli_vm_create.py`: `--yes` preserves existing active VM, `--set_default` opts in, and interactive prompt path with No keeps existing active VM.

## 2026-03-03 20:38:10 +0000

Added a “yes to remaining privileged operations” path to sudo confirmation flow without requiring `--yes-sudo`. Implementation is in `aivm/util.py` and `aivm/cli/_common.py`: the sudo prompt now accepts `[a]ll`, which re-arms sudo intent as `yes=True` for the rest of the current command run. `_confirm_sudo_block()` now checks this sticky intent via `sudo_intent_auto_yes()` so later privileged checkpoints are auto-approved after the user opts in once.

Reflection/state of mind: this change preserves safety while reducing prompt fatigue in multi-step flows. It keeps explicit per-run consent in-band and avoids forcing users to restart command invocation with flags when they decide mid-run they trust the remaining privileged actions.

Uncertainties/risks: sticky approval scope is per-process/current invocation (intent context), not persisted to config; this matches expected transient behavior but users might assume persistence similar to `behavior.yes_sudo`. Prompt wording could still be improved for discoverability in long logs.

Tradeoffs and what might break: changed sudo prompt text from `[y/N]` to `[y]es/[a]ll/[N]o`. Any tests/tools matching exact prompt text needed updates. Non-interactive behavior remains unchanged.

What I am confident about: compile checks pass for touched modules; new tests cover sticky-all behavior in util and confirm-block honoring of sticky state (`tests/test_util.py`, `tests/test_cli_helpers.py`).

## 2026-03-03 20:46:36 +0000

Addressed a first-boot/share-mount race in `aivm ssh .` / attached-session flows by hardening guest mount reconciliation. In `aivm/vm/share.py`, `ensure_share_mounted()` now runs a bounded retry loop (12 attempts, 2s interval) instead of a single mount attempt. It emits clear user-facing logs on first failure and subsequent retries, then raises a structured RuntimeError with context if retries are exhausted.

Reflection/state of mind: this was a practical reliability fix aimed at demo/operator experience. The failure signature (SSH ready but first virtiofs mount returns code 32, second invocation succeeds) strongly suggests readiness lag; retrying at the mount boundary is the least invasive and most user-visible mitigation.

Uncertainties/risks: retries are generic for nonzero mount outcomes, so truly permanent mount failures now take ~22 seconds longer before surfacing. I considered heuristic filtering by stderr, but that is brittle across distros/locales; a bounded retry with explicit logs is safer and easier to reason about.

Tradeoffs and what might break: error timing changes (later failure) for persistent mount issues; however logs now make this explicit and actionable. No behavior change for successful first-attempt mounts.

What I am confident about: compile checks pass; added tests in `tests/test_vm_helpers.py` cover retry-then-success and exhausted-retry failure paths for `ensure_share_mounted()`.

## 2026-03-03 20:57:17 +0000

Implemented checksum validation for downloaded Ubuntu cloud images in `fetch_image()`. Added image config knobs (`image.sha256`, `image.sha256sums_url`) and verification flow in `aivm/vm/lifecycle.py`: when downloading an Ubuntu cloud image URL, aivm now resolves expected SHA256 from explicit config or upstream `SHA256SUMS`, computes local digest via `sha256sum`, and fails hard on mismatch while removing the invalid image.

Reflection/state of mind: this is a supply-chain integrity improvement with low operational complexity. I intentionally scoped mandatory auto-resolution to Ubuntu cloud image URLs so common defaults are protected without forcing checksum infrastructure on arbitrary custom image sources.

Uncertainties/risks: for Ubuntu URLs, a download now depends on access to checksum index endpoint unless `image.sha256` is pinned. Environments with restricted outbound networking may need to set explicit checksum (and optionally local sums URL) for deterministic behavior.

Tradeoffs and what might break: first-time Ubuntu downloads do one extra metadata fetch (`SHA256SUMS`) and one hash computation (`sha256sum`), adding startup latency. Cached-image fast path remains unchanged and does not re-verify to avoid repeated startup cost.

What I am confident about: compile checks pass, and tests now cover checksum validation success and mismatch failure/removal paths in `tests/test_vm_helpers.py`.

## 2026-03-03 21:01:55 +0000

Refined image checksum design per feedback: removed user-facing checksum knobs and switched to an internal supported-image hash registry. In `aivm/config.py`, dropped `ImageConfig.sha256` / `sha256sums_url` and introduced `SUPPORTED_IMAGE_SHA256` keyed by supported image URLs (currently default Ubuntu noble cloud image URL). In `aivm/vm/lifecycle.py`, checksum resolution now enforces membership in this registry and fails fast for unsupported URLs; post-download SHA256 verification remains mandatory with cleanup-on-mismatch.

Reflection/state of mind: this aligns security policy with usability. Asking users to source hashes themselves was the wrong UX burden; a curated internal registry gives deterministic integrity checks and clearer trust boundaries.

Uncertainties/risks: registry entries can go stale if upstream “current” URLs roll to new artifacts. That means maintainers must refresh hashes when supported image URLs change content. This is intentional but requires lightweight maintenance discipline.

Tradeoffs and what might break: custom image URLs that previously worked will now fail unless added to the built-in registry; this is a deliberate tightening to avoid unverified downloads.

What I am confident about: compile checks pass and tests were updated for the new model (registered URL success, mismatch removal, unsupported URL rejection) in `tests/test_vm_helpers.py`.

## 2026-03-03 21:05:14 +0000

Pinned the default Ubuntu image URL to a dated artifact path (`/noble/20260225/...`) instead of `/current/` so the configured URL and built-in SHA256 refer to the same immutable object. Updated tests that hardcoded `/current/` to use `DEFAULT_UBUNTU_NOBLE_IMG_URL` for consistency.

Reflection/state of mind: this change closes the integrity gap where a mutable URL could drift underneath a fixed hash. It makes the security model coherent: one URL, one digest, predictable verification.

Uncertainties/risks: pinned daily URLs eventually age out operationally (security updates) and must be refreshed intentionally; this is expected and preferable to silent drift from `current`.

Tradeoffs and what might break: users expecting automatic movement to latest daily image will no longer get that implicitly. They now need code/config updates when we intentionally roll the pinned default.

What I am confident about: compile checks pass and the default + tests are now aligned on the pinned URL.

## 2026-03-04 03:01:55 +0000

Fixed a compatibility regression introduced by pinned image URL enforcement. Existing stores/VM templates may still carry the legacy mutable URL (`.../noble/current/...`), which was failing hard against the supported-image registry. Added `SUPPORTED_IMAGE_URL_ALIASES` in `aivm/config.py` and canonicalization in `fetch_image()` (`aivm/vm/lifecycle.py`) so legacy known URLs are automatically mapped to the pinned canonical URL before download + checksum verification.

Reflection/state of mind: this keeps the stronger security stance (pinned download + built-in hash) without forcing users to manually edit existing config stores immediately. It is a practical migration shim that preserves intent and reduces breakage.

Uncertainties/risks: alias table requires maintenance when defaults are rotated again; if stale aliases remain indefinitely, code complexity can creep. Current alias set is intentionally small and explicit.

Tradeoffs and what might break: users with truly custom URLs are still rejected by design. Legacy known URL now logs a warning and proceeds via canonical pinned URL, which changes exactly what gets downloaded compared to historical `current` behavior.

What I am confident about: compile checks pass; added regression coverage in `tests/test_vm_helpers.py` to ensure legacy URL is accepted and canonical pinned URL is used for the actual download command.

## 2026-03-04 03:06:18 +0000

Implemented host-aware VM sizing defaults in `aivm detect auto_defaults`. Added a tiered recommendation helper (`_recommend_vm_resources`) in `aivm/detect.py` based on host CPU count, total RAM, and free disk at `paths.base_dir`. `auto_defaults` now sets `vm.cpus`, `vm.ram_mb`, and `vm.disk_gb` using these recommendations and logs detected host/resource context.

Reflection/state of mind: this change improves first-run ergonomics by making init defaults less arbitrary and less likely to overcommit constrained hosts. I intentionally chose transparent tier thresholds over complex formulas so behavior is predictable and easy to tune in follow-ups.

Uncertainties/risks: tier boundaries are heuristic and may still be suboptimal for some environments (e.g., memory-heavy workstations where users might prefer larger defaults). Since interactive init already supports edit, this is acceptable for now but could benefit from telemetry/feedback-based tuning.

Tradeoffs and what might break: users previously accustomed to static defaults may notice changed default values after `config init`. This is expected and aligned with environment-aware behavior.

What I am confident about: compile checks pass and tests now cover constrained and large host sizing as well as auto-default integration (`tests/test_detect.py`).

## 2026-03-04 03:12:54 +0000

Fixed attached-session bootstrap behavior for the case "config exists with defaults, but no VM definitions yet." Previously `_prepare_attached_session()` unconditionally treated missing VM definitions as needing both `config init` and `vm create`. It now inspects the failing store path, checks whether defaults already exist, and runs only the missing step:
- defaults missing -> run `config init` then `vm create`
- defaults present -> run `vm create` only

Also updated interactive/non-interactive wording to avoid implying `config init` is always required when defaults already exist.

Reflection/state of mind: this was an accuracy/UX correction rather than a deep lifecycle bug. The fallback was too coarse and leaked an implementation assumption into user guidance. The safer design is state-driven bootstrap from store contents.

Uncertainties/risks: path extraction currently relies on the existing resolver error format (regex over message). If that message changes, fallback uses `_cfg_path(config_opt)`; behavior remains functional but could lose precision in mocked contexts.

Tradeoffs and what might break: minor prompt text changes; automation behavior should improve (fewer unnecessary init calls).

What I am confident about: compile checks pass and tests now cover both bootstrap branches in `tests/test_cli_vm_update.py`.

## 2026-03-04 03:15:01 +0000

Addressed two follow-up test regressions.

1) Removed legacy image URL support completely, per policy decision.
- Deleted legacy alias constants from `aivm/config.py`.
- Removed URL canonicalization path from `aivm/vm/lifecycle.py`.
- Removed legacy URL acceptance test from `tests/test_vm_helpers.py`.
- Kept strict supported-URL registry enforcement.

2) Fixed bootstrap branch detection in `_prepare_attached_session()`.
- Previous store-path parsing used a fragile regex that broke when the path contained dots (e.g. `~/.config/...`), causing false `need_init=True` and incorrectly calling `config init` even when defaults existed.
- Replaced with deterministic prefix/suffix splitting based on known resolver error text, with fallback to `_cfg_path(config_opt)`.

Reflection/state of mind: this was cleanup and correctness hardening after fast iteration. The main bug was self-inflicted string parsing fragility; path parsing should avoid ambiguous regex delimiters when path text can contain dots.

Uncertainties/risks: error-text parsing still depends on resolver message shape, but now in a more robust way and with a safe fallback. A future refactor could return structured error context instead of parsing strings.

What I am confident about: py_compile passes for all touched files and the two reported failing tests should now align with intended behavior.

## 2026-03-07 16:18:13 +0000

Added an aggregate extras setup in `pyproject.toml` so users can install all optional dependency groups with one selector. Introduced a missing `docs` extras group (aligned with existing documentation requirements in `requirements/docs.txt`) and added `all` as an umbrella extra including `optional`, `tests`, and `docs`.

Reflection/state of mind: this was a small but high-leverage packaging ergonomics change. The goal was to reduce friction for contributors and CI setups that need full feature/test/doc dependencies without requiring multiple extras or ad-hoc requirements files.

Uncertainties/risks: pin ranges between `requirements/*.txt` and extras may drift over time because they are defined in multiple places. If that drift appears, consolidating to a single source of truth for all dependency groups would be safer.

Tradeoffs and what might break: `all` references self-extras (`aivm[...]`), which is valid for extras aggregation but may expose installer edge cases on very old tooling; with modern pip/setuptools this should be stable.

What I am confident about: the extras table now exposes all current optional groups and provides the requested `all` convenience target.

## 2026-03-07 17:07:09 +0000

Worked on hardening e2e preflight checks after failures where tests proceeded into privileged network creation and then failed with `sudo: virsh: command not found`. Added a sudo-aware dependency probe (`check_commands_with_sudo`) and exposed it through `aivm host doctor --sudo`. Updated e2e tests to invoke this doctor preflight early and skip with diagnostics when dependencies are not available in the same sudo context used by runtime operations.

Reflection/state of mind: the key issue was mismatch between “tool exists for current user” and “tool exists where privileged commands actually execute.” This was a correctness gap in test gating, not VM lifecycle logic, so the fix needed to shift failure earlier and make the reason explicit.

Uncertainties/risks: the sudo probe uses `sh -lc 'command -v ...'`, which assumes a conventional POSIX shell under sudo; this is a pragmatic baseline but still shell-dependent. If environments heavily customize sudo behavior, false negatives remain possible.

Tradeoffs and what might break: `host doctor --sudo` now requires non-interactive sudo and returns a failing code when that precondition is absent. That is intentional for CI/e2e readiness, but interactive local users without passwordless sudo should continue using plain `host doctor`.

What I am confident about: unit coverage for the new host helper passes, and both e2e modules now enforce dependency readiness before network/VM operations, preventing the mid-test failure mode and associated cleanup churn.

## 2026-03-07 17:12:31 +0000

Adjusted e2e readiness and image handling after feedback from failed runs. Replaced dependency preflight skip behavior with hard failure semantics so e2e surfaces unmet host prerequisites as explicit test failures. Also tightened image-source handling by allowing `file://` image URLs only when their SHA256 matches a digest from the built-in supported-image registry; this keeps the strict trust model while supporting local cached mirrors of pinned images.

In parallel, hardened the e2e shared image cache helper: switched to atomic download (`.part` then rename), checksum verification both for existing cache reuse and post-download integrity, and default cache naming derived from the pinned URL version segment to avoid stale/mutable filename reuse.

Reflection/state of mind: this iteration focused on aligning behavior with user intent and operational reality. The prior “skip on doctor failure” was polite but hid actionable setup errors in a pipeline intended to validate end-to-end correctness. Likewise, the image-cache path needed stronger anti-corruption semantics because interrupted transfers are expected in real workflows.

Uncertainties/risks: deriving cache version from URL path structure assumes Ubuntu cloud-image URL layout stays similar. If upstream path conventions change, naming may degrade (still functional, less descriptive). Also, file URL verification now computes source hashes in-process and may add slight startup cost for large local images.

Tradeoffs and what might break: local `file://` URLs are no longer categorically rejected, but only accepted when they hash-match a known supported image. Custom local images outside the registry continue to fail by design. E2E dependency preflight now fails the test instead of skipping, which may increase red builds on under-provisioned hosts but is intended.

What I am confident about: targeted unit tests cover supported/unsupported file URL behavior in `fetch_image`, and preflight/error-path updates compile and pass relevant non-e2e test subsets.

## 2026-03-07 17:17:47 +0000

Created a formal design contract document to anchor project intent and reduce drift during rapid iteration. Added `docs/source/design.rst` with product scope, UX objectives, design principles (including idempotency and atomic operations), implementation invariants, code organization/style guidance (including scriptconfig usage), and an append-only decision-record process with starter entries from today’s recent changes.

Reflection/state of mind: the repository has been moving quickly with meaningful behavior changes, and without a durable north-star doc it is easy for tactical fixes to fragment architectural intent. This document is meant to make tradeoffs explicit and keep future changes auditable at the design level.

Uncertainties/risks: any such document can become stale if updates are not enforced as part of review flow. The decision-log process is only effective if contributors actively append entries for design-level changes.

Tradeoffs and what might break: no runtime behavior changed; risk is primarily social/process-based (maintenance discipline). Added links in docs index and README to increase discoverability and reduce risk of silent staleness.

What I am confident about: the design contract now exists in-tree, is reachable from both README and docs toctree, and includes concrete rules/templates that future contributors can follow.

## 2026-03-07 17:21:44 +0000

Reworked `docs/source/design.rst` based on recurring patterns in the journal rather than recent point-fixes. Removed dated decision snippets and replaced them with an evergreen design contract: product intent, single-source-of-truth state model, reconciliation/idempotency expectations, safety/trust boundaries, atomic operation guidance, preflight/readiness expectations, observability rules, scriptconfig-oriented CLI architecture conventions, testing contract, and a neutral decision-update template.

Reflection/state of mind: this pass was about tightening the distinction between "history" and "contract." The previous draft mixed durable principles with recent implementation specifics. The updated version is intentionally less event-driven and more governance-oriented so it stays useful over time.

Uncertainties/risks: some principles are still broad and may need further sharpening into strict acceptance criteria if contributors interpret them differently. The document is now directionally aligned, but enforcement remains a process discipline issue.

Tradeoffs and what might break: no runtime code changed. The tradeoff is less concrete historical detail in the design doc itself, with history now intentionally delegated to the journal.

What I am confident about: the design doc now reflects long-running architecture/UX patterns encouraged in prior work (explicit safety boundaries, idempotent reconcile flows, atomic host/file operations, scriptconfig-based CLI structure) without depending on dated references.

## 2026-03-07 17:23:37 +0000

Updated the evergreen design contract per user direction. Moved `Non-goals` to the end of `docs/source/design.rst`, expanded primary product outcomes to emphasize low cognitive load for non-VM users and host-like default development flow (`code`/`ssh` from working directories after attachment), clarified provisioning stance as intentionally basic/user-directed, and added forward-looking trust-mode guidance for secret-sensitive workflows (future read-only mounts and potential git-based synchronization).

Reflection/state of mind: this pass improved alignment with practical intent over abstract architecture language. The prior draft captured many principles but underrepresented the ergonomic goal that non-VM users should barely have to think about virtualization mechanics.

Uncertainties/risks: future sync/isolation modes are intentionally framed as direction rather than commitment, so exact implementation boundaries remain open. That ambiguity is useful now but will need concretization when those features are prioritized.

Tradeoffs and what might break: no runtime behavior changed; this is documentation-only. The tradeoff is committing more explicitly to UX simplicity while preserving strong safety/trust language.

What I am confident about: the design doc now better reflects intended user experience and future security-minded workflow options while remaining evergreen.

## 2026-03-07 17:29:39 +0000

Updated the design contract to explicitly require hash verification for downloaded artifacts and to encourage content-addressable fallbacks for data access. Added a new reliability subsection in `docs/source/design.rst` and an `Implementation TODO Notes` section that points to concrete modules needing follow-on work.

Also added inline `TODO(design)` markers in runtime code where this policy is not fully realized yet: image fetch currently trusts existing named cache files by existence (`aivm/vm/lifecycle.py`), image config identity is still name-based (`aivm/config.py`), and status currently reflects only named cache paths (`aivm/status.py`).

Reflection/state of mind: this was a contract-tightening pass, not a behavior change pass. The goal was to capture a strong invariant now and make the implementation gaps explicit at exact callsites to keep future work focused.

Uncertainties/risks: content-addressable fallback can be implemented in multiple ways (layout, migration, backward compatibility), so TODOs intentionally avoid overcommitting to one storage schema. The risk is that partial implementation could create dual-path complexity if not planned holistically.

Tradeoffs and what might break: no runtime behavior changed in this step. Main tradeoff is increased visible technical debt markers, which is intentional to keep the policy actionable.

What I am confident about: the design doc now states the requirement unambiguously, and the codebase has concrete TODO anchors where implementation changes are needed.

## 2026-03-07 17:33:40 +0000

Added a targeted design TODO to include `uv` in baseline provisioning defaults in `docs/source/design.rst` (Implementation TODO Notes). This captures the desired future direction without changing runtime provisioning behavior yet.

Reflection/state of mind: this is a small but useful alignment update. Capturing package-tooling expectations in the design TODO list helps avoid drift between intended developer workflow and current bootstrap defaults.

Uncertainties/risks: adding `uv` to default provisioning later may require distro/package-manager handling details and idempotent install strategy in constrained hosts.

Tradeoffs and what might break: no behavior changes in this step; documentation-only change.

What I am confident about: the design contract now explicitly tracks the `uv` provisioning follow-up.

## 2026-03-07 17:35:17 +0000

Added code-level TODO markers for future `uv` provisioning work without modifying the design contract. Placed TODOs at the practical implementation points: provisioning defaults in `aivm/config.py`, cloud-init guest base package block in `aivm/vm/lifecycle.py`, and the post-boot provisioning routine in `aivm/vm/lifecycle.py` where install/version checks can be implemented.

Reflection/state of mind: this was intentionally narrow and tactical, matching the request to stop evolving design text and instead annotate execution points that future implementation work will touch.

Uncertainties/risks: final `uv` install strategy (apt package vs installer script, version pinning policy, and where to enforce checks) is still open, so TODOs are directional rather than prescriptive.

Tradeoffs and what might break: no runtime behavior changed; comments-only updates.

What I am confident about: TODOs now exist in the exact code paths where `uv` provisioning changes will need to land.

## 2026-03-07 17:44:17 +0000

Implemented a two-style e2e structure and expanded coverage toward fresh-user confidence. Existing e2e tests now explicitly represent `host-context` mode (current host executes full VM lifecycle checks), while a new opt-in `bootstrap-context` e2e (`tests/test_e2e_bootstrap_context.py`) creates an outer VM, provisions host dependencies inside it, installs `aivm` from the attached repo, and invokes the host-context e2e suite from within that outer VM.

Also updated `run_e2e_tests.sh` to run host-context tests by default and include bootstrap-context only when `AIVM_E2E_BOOTSTRAP=1` is set. Added `AIVM_E2E_HOST_CONTEXT` gating to host-context tests to prevent accidental recursion when bootstrap mode runs nested pytest inside the guest.

Reflection/state of mind: this is the right decomposition for confidence without duplicating behavioral assertions. Bootstrap validates “new user from fresh environment” setup flow, and host-context remains the canonical behavior suite.

Uncertainties/risks: bootstrap-context runtime is long and environment-sensitive (nested virtualization `/dev/kvm`, guest apt mirrors, libvirtd service behavior in guest). This is intentionally opt-in to keep default local cycles practical.

Tradeoffs and what might break: additional complexity in e2e orchestration and more moving parts for bootstrap mode; however host-context path remains unchanged for normal runs and non-e2e test runs still skip cleanly.

What I am confident about: syntax checks pass, e2e modules import and skip correctly in default mode, and the bootstrap test executes the intended layering model (outer VM runs host-context e2e suite) when enabled.

## 2026-03-07 21:00:02 +0000

Worked on stabilizing `tests/test_e2e_bootstrap_context.py` while actively running the bootstrap e2e path under `AIVM_E2E=1 AIVM_E2E_BOOTSTRAP=1 AIVM_E2E_HOST_CONTEXT=0`. The main concrete changes were: making missing passwordless sudo a hard failure with captured stderr/stdout (instead of skip), hardening SSH transport options (`BatchMode`, connect timeout, connection attempts, server-alive keepalives) to reduce silent hangs on transport loss, and cleaning up the remote bootstrap script preamble so it no longer dumps the full environment unexpectedly.

Reflection/state of mind: this session felt like reliability surgery under load. The test is functionally doing the right layered work, but the operational failure mode was painful: very long nested runs with weak failure signaling when the outer guest became unreachable. I focused on making failures deterministic and informative before chasing optimization.

Uncertainties/risks: full bootstrap execution is still very long, and the nested path remains vulnerable to long dependency-install windows and network variability in cloud-init/apt phases. I observed successful progression through dependency installation and into nested host-context test execution after the harness fixes, but I did not capture a complete end-to-end green run in this session.

Tradeoffs and what might break: stricter sudo behavior may fail environments that previously skipped silently; this is intentional per desired semantics. SSH keepalive/timeout settings may surface failures faster in flaky networks, which improves debuggability but can reduce tolerance for transient outages.

What I am confident about: bootstrap harness behavior is now clearer and less likely to hang without signal; generated libvirt artifacts from aborted attempts were cleaned up; the modified test file compiles (`python -m py_compile tests/test_e2e_bootstrap_context.py`).

## 2026-03-07 21:10:17 +0000

Implemented the requested shift toward tool-owned dependency setup in the bootstrap e2e path and completed the `uv` provisioning TODO in core lifecycle code. Concretely: added baseline guest `uv` bootstrap in cloud-init `runcmd` (best-effort), added explicit `uv` ensure logic in `vm.provision` (apt install fallback to pip with `--break-system-packages`), removed the stale config/lifecycle TODO markers, and rewired `tests/test_e2e_bootstrap_context.py` so the first-layer VM now does minimal Python bootstrap then runs `python -m aivm host install_deps --yes` and `python -m aivm host doctor --sudo` before nested e2e.

Reflection/state of mind: this moved the test architecture closer to the product contract. The previous bootstrap script duplicated too much host install logic manually, which made failures harder to interpret and drift more likely. Centering dependency setup behind `aivm` reduces that drift.

Uncertainties/risks: `uv` installation still relies on online package sources (apt/pip) and currently uses best-effort behavior in cloud-init; highly constrained/offline environments may still fail. Also, I have not completed another full bootstrap e2e run in this session after these specific changes, so only static validation has been done so far.

Tradeoffs and what might break: adding `uv` checks in provisioning introduces one more install path and therefore one more failure surface on locked-down systems. However, this is balanced by fallback logic and by moving the heavy host dependency install workflow into one canonical command path.

What I am confident about: code compiles cleanly, bootstrap test now delegates host dependency installation to the CLI tool as intended, and `uv` provisioning is now implemented in core lifecycle flows rather than just captured as TODO comments.

## 2026-03-07 21:14:24 +0000

Adjusted `uv` provisioning behavior to be strictly user-space, per updated requirement. Removed the cloud-init root-level `uv` install attempt and replaced provisioning/bootstrap install logic with the official user installer (`curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`) while explicitly prepending `$HOME/.local/bin` to `PATH` before use.

Reflection/state of mind: this was a good correction. The earlier implementation solved availability but violated a core packaging hygiene constraint (no system-package breakage). This revision better matches principle and reduces host/guest package-manager side effects.

Uncertainties/risks: user-space installer depends on outbound network access to astral.sh unless `uv` is already present. In restricted environments this could still fail; the flow now fails clearly at `command -v uv` if install is not possible.

Tradeoffs and what might break: we lose distro-package fallback for `uv` in provisioning, so environments that block installer access must preinstall `uv` for the user. This is intentional to avoid touching system package state.

What I am confident about: no remaining `--break-system-packages` or system `uv` apt install paths in modified lifecycle/bootstrap files; static compile checks pass.

## 2026-03-07 21:16:19 +0000

Updated `AGENTS.md` to add explicit guidance on code comments: write code naturally first, then do a short second pass to add concise high-level comments about steps/motivation where helpful; avoid over-commenting and prefer intent-level comments for non-obvious logic.

Reflection/state of mind: this is a useful process constraint because it balances implementation flow with maintainability. It avoids forcing commentary during drafting while still requiring final readability for future agents/users.

Uncertainties/risks: “when appropriate” is intentionally subjective, so consistency still depends on reviewer discipline.

Tradeoffs and what might break: no runtime impact; documentation/process-only change.

What I am confident about: repo guidance now explicitly encodes the requested comment style and timing (second-pass annotation).

Applied a second-pass comment sweep to e2e test scripts (`tests/test_e2e_nested.py`, `tests/test_e2e_full.py`, `tests/test_e2e_bootstrap_context.py`) to add concise high-level guidance about test phases, motivation for helper behavior, and resource-isolation intent (without over-commenting implementation details).

Reflection/state of mind: this pass was about readability and transfer-of-context for both humans and agents. The code was already functional, but critical assumptions (fail-fast dependency checks, unique resource naming, bootstrap layering intent) were too implicit.

Uncertainties/risks: comment quality can drift over time if behavior changes and comments are not updated. I kept comments narrow and intent-focused to reduce stale-detail risk.

Tradeoffs and what might break: no runtime behavior changes from this pass; readability/documentation-only updates in tests.

What I am confident about: the e2e scripts now include clear high-level narrative cues at non-obvious points, and they still compile cleanly.

## 2026-03-07 21:24:58 +0000

Added a new top-level helper script `run_e2e_bootstrap_tests.sh` to run only bootstrap-context e2e with correct default env flags: `AIVM_E2E=1`, `AIVM_E2E_BOOTSTRAP=1`, and `AIVM_E2E_HOST_CONTEXT=0`, then invoke `pytest tests/test_e2e_bootstrap_context.py -s -v`.

Reflection/state of mind: this is a straightforward DX improvement. The bootstrap path has enough mode flags that a dedicated entrypoint is worth it to avoid repeated manual setup errors.

Uncertainties/risks: none significant; behavior is a thin wrapper over existing pytest invocation and env toggles.

Tradeoffs and what might break: no runtime/library behavior changes; only adds a convenience script and executable bit.

What I am confident about: script is executable and configured to run bootstrap-context only, which matches intended usage.

## 2026-03-07 21:30:14 +0000

Updated the design contract in `docs/source/design.rst` to capture a host-write observability rule: when `aivm` writes a file to the host system, it should log a note about that write; when reconciliation determines there is nothing to change, it should avoid both the write and the normal note, with an optional debug log for the no-op case.

Reflection/state of mind: this is a small documentation change, but it closes an ambiguity that tends to matter later when implementing idempotent file writes. Without saying this explicitly, it is easy to drift into noisy “wrote file” messaging even when nothing changed, which weakens operator trust in the logs.

Uncertainties/risks: the design note does not yet define the exact logging API or severity naming beyond “note” versus optional debug, so implementation details still need to stay consistent across modules.

Tradeoffs and what might break: keeping no-op writes silent at normal verbosity reduces noise and better matches idempotent behavior, but it can hide why nothing happened unless debug logging is available and used thoughtfully.

What I am confident about: the design doc now states the intended behavior clearly enough to guide future implementation and reviews around host-side file generation/reconciliation.

## 2026-03-07 21:33:38 +0000

Refined the coding-guidance language in `AGENTS.md` so the repository expectation is explicit: comments should help humans understand the high-level flow, motivation, and non-obvious steps, while still avoiding line-by-line narration.

Reflection/state of mind: this is mostly about tightening the wording around an existing norm. The repo already leaned in this direction, but the stronger phrasing makes it clearer that comments are not just optional decoration; they are part of making complex VM and provisioning logic maintainable for the next reader.

Uncertainties/risks: “high-level” and “non-obvious” still require judgment during review, so there is no fully mechanical threshold for enough commentary versus too much.

Tradeoffs and what might break: stronger guidance may encourage slightly more comments in new code, which is useful if they stay intent-focused, but stale comments remain a risk if implementation changes without the second pass being revisited.

What I am confident about: `AGENTS.md` now states the desired comment style more directly and in terms that are useful for both human contributors and future agents.

## 2026-03-07 21:37:15 +0000

Adjusted the bootstrap e2e path so debug-level `aivm` logging is the default. The wrapper script now exports `AIVM_E2E_CLI_VERBOSITY=2` unless overridden, and `tests/test_e2e_bootstrap_context.py` uses that setting to prepend the needed `-vv` flags to the initial outer host dependency check, the later outer host-side `aivm` lifecycle commands, and the inner guest-side bootstrap `aivm` commands.

Reflection/state of mind: this was worth tightening because bootstrap failures are expensive and usually occur after several minutes of setup. In that situation, defaulting to info-level logs is the wrong tradeoff; the extra command-level detail is more valuable than quiet output.

Uncertainties/risks: this only changes the bootstrap-context path, not every e2e entrypoint. Nested/full tests run directly outside bootstrap will keep their existing verbosity behavior unless they are invoked through the bootstrap wrapper or given explicit flags.

Tradeoffs and what might break: debug-by-default increases output volume significantly, especially around repeated command execution and retries. That is intentional for bootstrap runs, but it may make logs noisier to scan if someone only wanted a minimal smoke signal.

What I am confident about: the bootstrap path now requests debug-level `aivm` logs consistently on both sides of the SSH boundary, and the override remains configurable through `AIVM_E2E_CLI_VERBOSITY`.

## 2026-03-07 21:59:32 +0000

Worked directly on `tests/test_e2e_bootstrap_context.py` by running the bootstrap e2e repeatedly with full host access and trimming it toward the intended product contract. The original inner payload was effectively “install nested host deps, then run the entire nested/full e2e suite inside the level-1 guest”, which is broader and noisier than the stated bootstrap goal. I rewrote that payload to install `aivm` in the fresh guest and exercise a smaller set of documented non-interactive workflows (`help tree`, `config init`, `vm create`, `vm wait_ip`, `status`, `attach`, `list`, `vm ssh_config`, `vm update`, cleanup). While doing that I fixed several concrete harness issues: wrong placement of verbosity flags for modal subcommands, positional-argument ambiguity from repeated `-v`, missing guest SSH key generation before `config init`/`vm create`, using a guest-local venv instead of writing `.venv-e2e` into the shared repo mount, and adding `--yes` for the non-interactive `status --sudo` path.

Reflection/state of mind: this felt like peeling away accidental test architecture rather than chasing one isolated bug. The biggest insight was that the bootstrap test had drifted into “nested test runner of everything” instead of “fresh user workflow check”, and that drift was creating both the runtime cost and the failure surface. Once that was obvious, the debugging became much more concrete.

Uncertainties/risks: a full green bootstrap rerun after the most recent guest-key and `status --sudo --yes` fixes is still in progress as of this entry, so I do not yet have a final passing end-to-end result for the simplified path. The remaining runtime cost is dominated by guest-side `aivm host install_deps`, which is expected but still slow.

Tradeoffs and what might break: simplifying the inner bootstrap flow means bootstrap no longer implicitly re-validates every behavior covered by `tests/test_e2e_nested.py` and `tests/test_e2e_full.py`. That is intentional; those suites still exist for their own scope, while bootstrap should stay focused on first-run onboarding. The risk is that if reviewers expected bootstrap to be a superset of those suites, coverage assumptions need to be updated.

What I am confident about: the bootstrap harness is now much closer to the intended “fresh user system” story, the deterministic argument-parsing and missing-key failures have been addressed in code, and the current verification run is exercising a substantially smaller and more defensible inner scenario than before.
## 2026-03-08 06:58:25 +0000

Worked the bootstrap and full-suite e2e validation loop to ground. The key runtime bug turned out to be in `aivm.vm.lifecycle.wait_for_ssh()`: nested guests were reachable, but first-login SSH handshakes could take roughly 20-40 seconds under cloud-init, key generation, and nested virtualization pressure, while the probe path was still treating them as effectively dead. I fixed that in core code by giving each readiness probe a bounded but materially larger timeout, kept the overall wait budget intact, and removed invalid datasource keys from generated cloud-init user-data so the guest config no longer emits schema warnings during boot. I also added focused regression tests around the cloud-init rendering and SSH probe timeout behavior.

Reflection/state of mind: this was a good example of why I do not trust a failing long-running e2e at face value. The initial temptation is to patch the test harness again, but the evidence showed the product code was prematurely declaring failure even though the guest was alive and later accepted SSH. Once that was clear, the right move was to fix the core wait logic and rerun from a clean contiguous test sequence rather than arguing from partial signals.

Uncertainties/risks: the bootstrap path is still expensive. A true fresh-machine run spends most of its wall-clock time downloading the Ubuntu image and installing libvirt/qemu dependencies inside the outer guest. That is intended coverage, but it means future regressions in network speed, upstream package mirrors, or nested-virt performance will still show up as long tests rather than tight feedback loops.

Tradeoffs and what might break: increasing the per-probe SSH timeout makes readiness checks more patient, which is necessary for nested first boot, but it also means a genuinely unhealthy guest may take longer to be declared unavailable. I kept the overall timeout unchanged so the trade stays local to the handshake step rather than broadening the full wait budget. Removing the invalid cloud-init datasource keys should reduce noise and ambiguity, but if there was any accidental reliance on those unsupported keys, the only reason it worked before was cloud-init tolerating them rather than them being correct.

What I am confident about: the standalone bootstrap e2e passed end-to-end with real image downloads, and the final post-edit contiguous validation run also passed with `AIVM_E2E=1 AIVM_E2E_HOST_CONTEXT=1 AIVM_E2E_BOOTSTRAP=1 pytest -q`, covering the normal suite, host-context e2e, and bootstrap e2e in one run (`125 passed`).

## 2026-03-08 13:42:26 +0000

Added a small design TODO in `aivm/config.py` above the pinned Noble image URL declaration. The note captures an architectural direction that has been implicit in recent debugging: network-fetched assets should not be modeled as an ad-hoc URL constant plus a separate hash mapping when we already know we want richer provenance and fallback metadata.

Reflection/state of mind: this was intentionally a documentation-only change in code, not a refactor. The main value is to put the design pressure at the exact declaration site so future implementation work starts from the right abstraction instead of growing more one-off globals around the current image registry.

Uncertainties/risks: the eventual shape could be a dataclass, a small registry object, or another typed container, so the TODO should be treated as directional rather than locking the implementation too early. The risk is mostly social: if the note is ignored, asset handling will stay fragmented as more mirrors or alternate transports get added.

Tradeoffs and what might break: nothing runtime changes here. The only tradeoff is adding one more intent-level comment near a central config constant, which is appropriate because the declaration is a design hotspot.

What I am confident about: the TODO now names the concrete metadata we are likely to need next for pinned image assets: primary URL, SHA256, mirrors, torrent magnet, and IPFS CID.

## 2026-03-09 17:50:46 +0000

Worked on folder-attachment persistence from the user-experience side rather than the low-level virtiofs side. The immediate issue was that after a host reboot, `aivm code .` / `aivm ssh .` only restored the current folder, while other folders already associated with the same VM stayed absent inside the guest until the user manually touched each one again. I added a small store helper to enumerate attachments by VM, then extended the attached-session startup path so it remounts the requested folder as before and best-effort restores the VM's other saved attachments once SSH is ready. The implementation intentionally keeps the current folder strict and the secondary folders forgiving: missing or invalid secondary host paths log warnings instead of aborting the main session. I also updated the README/workflows docs and added regression coverage around the new startup-restore behavior.

Reflection/state of mind: this felt like a product-contract correction more than a feature addition. The existing behavior was internally consistent once I read the code, but it violated what a user would reasonably infer from "this folder is attached to this VM". After a reboot, the right mental model is "bring my VM's working set back", not "only revive the one path I happened to launch from right now". That made the main design decision straightforward: broaden restore on startup, but do it in a way that does not strand the primary session on a stale secondary path.

Uncertainties/risks: secondary attachment restoration now depends on the saved registry still being the source of truth for those folders. If a user has very old or hand-edited attachment entries with unexpected guest destinations or tags, startup will honor them and try to reconcile against live libvirt mappings. That is usually what we want, but it means bad saved metadata can still surface as warnings during session startup.

Tradeoffs and what might break: I chose best-effort behavior for secondary attachments. That means `aivm code` / `aivm ssh` can succeed even if one of several saved folders no longer exists on the host or cannot be reattached cleanly. The tradeoff is that a user could miss a secondary restore failure unless they notice the warning logs. I think that is the better default because failing the main coding session over an old side attachment would be too brittle.

What I am confident about: the new path is covered by targeted tests, the primary attachment flow remains unchanged for single-folder sessions, and a VM recreate/start path will now repopulate saved secondary attachments instead of silently leaving them behind after boot.
## 2026-03-11 01:35:02 +0000

Worked on the `0.3.0` cut while adding a second attachment mode for folder-oriented workflows. The core change is that attachments are no longer treated as synonymous with virtiofs shares: `shared` remains the default, but `git` now records an attachment that seeds a guest-local clone, skips virtiofs reconciliation, and registers a pull-only Git remote in the host repo that targets the guest clone over the managed SSH alias. I kept the implementation inside the existing `attach` / `code` / `ssh` orchestration instead of adding a separate command family because the user intent is still “work in this folder with this VM”; only the transport changes.

Reflection/state of mind: this feature looked straightforward at the concept level, but the real engineering pressure was in not letting “attach” mean one hidden mechanism forever. The right move was to make mode explicit in the resolved attachment model and let session prep branch on that, otherwise every future isolation mode would keep fighting shared-folder assumptions baked into the main workflow. I also wanted to keep the host-side Git remote stable across VM IP churn, which is why I bound it to the existing SSH config alias rather than writing a transient raw-IP remote URL.

Uncertainties/risks: Git mode currently seeds committed repository state only. If the host worktree is dirty, the guest clone will not include those uncommitted changes, and if the requested host path only exists in uncommitted state the guest path will be missing and the flow now errors clearly. There is also an implicit assumption that the operator is attaching a Git worktree (or a subdirectory inside one); non-Git directories still need `shared` mode.

Tradeoffs and what might break: I chose host-driven seeding via a temporary mirrored repo copied over SSH/SCP instead of trying to make the guest clone directly from the host filesystem. That keeps the host repo unshared and works for ordinary repos, but it adds more moving pieces than virtiofs and depends on Git plus SSH/SCP behavior being available on the host side. I also left saved-attachment restoration focused on shared attachments because those are the ones that disappear across reboot; Git attachments persist on guest disk and only need remote refresh when they are actively used again.

What I am confident about: the mode split is covered by targeted tests, version metadata and docs were updated alongside the code, and the host-side remote registration is stable and idempotent for normal Git repos. The main residual rough edge is product policy around dirty worktrees, which is now surfaced clearly but not yet given a richer sync story.
## 2026-03-11 01:45:05 +0000

Tightened the Git-attachment documentation after noticing an ambiguity in my own wording. The code adds a host-side remote pointed at the guest clone's `.git` directory, which is enough for the host to fetch guest commits, but that should not be described as a general bidirectional push/pull channel. Pushing from the host into a checked-out non-bare guest repo is not configured as a supported update path here, and even when Git permits it under some settings it would still leave working-tree update semantics underspecified.

Reflection/state of mind: this is the kind of correction that matters because the implementation is easy to mentally round up into “Git sync in both directions” when it is really “guest-local clone plus host fetch access.” I wanted the docs to say exactly what the code guarantees, not what a future extension might enable.

Uncertainties/risks: operators may still try a manual `git push` to the generated remote out of habit. Depending on the guest repo state and Git defaults, that may fail fast or partially succeed in ways that do not match expectations. The docs now discourage that path explicitly, but the CLI itself does not yet enforce it.

Tradeoffs and what might break: being precise here makes the current feature look narrower, but that is preferable to advertising a push path that is not managed end-to-end. If we later decide to support host-to-guest push, we will need to choose an intentional design for checked-out-branch updates rather than inheriting Git's defaults accidentally.

What I am confident about: the documented contract now matches the implemented behavior more closely: seed committed host state into a guest-local clone, let the guest commit locally, and let the host fetch those guest commits through the registered remote.
## 2026-03-11 02:01:05 +0000

Reworked the Git attachment transport to match the user's intended two-working-copies model more closely. Instead of copying a temporary mirrored seed repo into the guest and cloning from it, the Git-mode path now prepares a normal repo directly at the guest destination, configures `receive.denyCurrentBranch=updateInstead`, registers a host-side remote pointing at that working repo, and pushes the current host branch into the guest repo. This keeps the UX centered on direct host<->guest sync while still limiting transfer to committed Git state.

Reflection/state of mind: this is a better fit for the actual product story. The temporary mirror was defensible as a conservative first pass, but it was making the workflow feel more like one-way seeding than two endpoints a developer intentionally syncs between. Once the comparison to `git_well.git_sync` was explicit, the cleaner abstraction was obvious: make the guest repo itself the endpoint and let Git's checked-out-branch update behavior be an intentional policy rather than an avoided edge case.

Uncertainties/risks: `updateInstead` still requires the guest working tree to be clean enough for Git to update it. If the VM side has incompatible local modifications, the host push will fail and the user will need to resolve or discard those changes. Detached HEAD on the host side is also rejected for now because there is no stable branch name to sync against.

Tradeoffs and what might break: direct push is simpler and aligns with the requested UX, but it is also less conservative than the mirror seed flow because the guest working copy is now a live receive endpoint. That is acceptable for the stated single-developer workflow, but it means Git-mode errors are now more about branch/worktree state than about seed creation. The docs were updated accordingly so the contract is explicit.

What I am confident about: the code path now matches the intended model much better, the host remote points at the guest working repo rather than a staging artifact, and the sync policy is anchored in a specific Git mechanism (`receive.denyCurrentBranch=updateInstead`) instead of ad hoc repo copying.
## 2026-03-12 19:13:45 +0000

Worked on hardening attachment-mode semantics to avoid silent trust-boundary flips. I changed the shared/git mode resolution path in `aivm/cli/vm.py` so an existing `(host folder, VM)` attachment now rejects an explicit conflicting `--mode` with a clear error instead of mutating the saved record. To support the intended explicit workflow, I added `aivm vm detach` and top-level `aivm detach` commands, wired command-tree registration in `aivm/cli/main.py`, and implemented detach behavior as: remove the saved attachment record, and for `shared` mode best-effort detach the virtiofs mapping from libvirt using a new helper (`detach_vm_share`) in `aivm/vm/share.py`.

Reflection/state of mind: this felt like an important safety-contract correction rather than a feature expansion. Silent in-place mode rewrites made it too easy to change from isolated git-backed workflow to direct host sharing (or vice versa) by accident. For attachment mode, explicit user intent should be reversible and auditable in command history, so forcing detach+reattach is the right bar.

Uncertainties/risks: detach currently prioritizes deterministic state-store cleanup and best-effort libvirt mapping cleanup for shared attachments. If the VM is running and the guest still has an old mountpoint active, the CLI cannot fully guarantee guest-side unmount without additional in-guest ops, so it now prints guidance. Another risk is user migration friction: scripts that previously used `--mode` to flip an existing attachment now need a two-step command sequence.

Tradeoffs and what might break: I chose strict rejection of mode mismatch at attachment resolution time, which is safer but intentionally breaks permissive behavior. I also introduced a new detach command surface instead of expecting manual config edits, which increases CLI surface area slightly but keeps the workflow explicit and discoverable.

What I am confident about: targeted regression tests cover mode-mismatch rejection, store-level removal semantics, and detach command behavior for shared/git attachments; full suite is green (`131 passed, 3 skipped`). README and workflows docs now spell out the exact default-mode behavior and the mandatory detach+reattach process for mode changes.
## 2026-03-12 19:40:34 +0000

Implemented a sudo-confirmation policy split between read-only and state-changing operations. The core wiring changes are in `aivm/cli/_common.py` and `aivm/util.py`: `_confirm_sudo_block` now accepts an action (`read` or `modify`), read-only sudo confirmations auto-approve by default, and sticky “all” approval remains explicit (user enters `a`) instead of being accidentally inferred from read-only auto-allow behavior. I added a config behavior flag `prompt_sudo_readonly` (default `false`) to support the strict mode you requested (`true` restores prompt-on-every-readonly-sudo behavior). Then I updated callsites to mark query/inspect/status probes as `action='read'` while leaving mutating operations on the existing confirmation path.

Reflection/state of mind: this was a policy-boundary cleanup that required careful separation of intent propagation from prompt behavior. The subtle bug to avoid was letting one auto-approved read probe implicitly approve later mutating sudo actions; the intent model now distinguishes sticky user approval from non-sticky auto-read approval.

Uncertainties/risks: action classification is callsite-driven, so future contributors can misclassify new sudo operations if they do not follow the same discipline. The current implementation catches invalid action values, but cannot infer read/write semantics from arbitrary shell commands.

Tradeoffs and what might break: default UX is smoother (fewer prompts for status/probes) but less visibly explicit in interactive sessions. Strict environments can flip `behavior.prompt_sudo_readonly=true` to retain previous prompting behavior. I also had to add explicit modify confirmations in a couple of paths that previously used one coarse “inspect + maybe change” prompt.

What I am confident about: behavior is covered by updated tests across helper/util/store/vm update paths, config lint supports the new behavior key, and full suite passes (`134 passed, 3 skipped`). README sudo-behavior docs now describe the default and strict policy toggle.
## 2026-03-12 20:08:17 +0000

Renamed the sudo read-probe policy key from `prompt_sudo_readonly` to `auto_approve_readonly_sudo` to make intent explicit and positive (true means auto-approve read-only sudo probes). I updated config dataclass/store serialization/docs/tests and switched CLI context variable names accordingly. I also kept backward compatibility in store loading by mapping legacy `prompt_sudo_readonly` into the new key with inverted semantics so existing configs preserve behavior after upgrade.

Reflection/state of mind: this naming cleanup materially improves readability and reduces polarity confusion in both docs and implementation. The old name forced mental inversion at callsites (`not prompt` means auto-approve); the new name aligns naturally with the default policy.

Uncertainties/risks: mixed environments may temporarily carry both keys in manually edited configs. Current load behavior prefers direct assignment when the new key is present and still maps old key when encountered, but config hygiene still depends on users eventually normalizing files.

Tradeoffs and what might break: for compatibility, lint now accepts both behavior keys, which avoids noisy failures on legacy stores but may allow stale key usage to persist longer.

What I am confident about: full suite is green (`135 passed, 3 skipped`), strict-mode semantics are preserved (`auto_approve_readonly_sudo=false`), and README now documents the new key name and default.
## 2026-03-12 20:09:17 +0000

Follow-up cleanup per user direction: removed backward compatibility for the renamed sudo policy key. The code now only recognizes `behavior.auto_approve_readonly_sudo`; legacy `prompt_sudo_readonly` handling was deleted from store load path and lint whitelist. I also removed the now-obsolete legacy-key test and re-ran the full suite.

Reflection/state of mind: this is the right move for current development phase because the compatibility branch was adding complexity without strong migration value yet. Keeping one canonical key reduces ambiguity and keeps docs/code/tests aligned.

Uncertainties/risks: old local config files using the legacy key will now silently fall back to default behavior (`auto_approve_readonly_sudo=true`) unless users update their config. That is acceptable given explicit non-compat direction, but worth watching in local dev environments.

Tradeoffs and what might break: strict-read-prompt users who had already written `prompt_sudo_readonly=true` need to rename it to `auto_approve_readonly_sudo=false`.

What I am confident about: test coverage and full suite remain green (`134 passed, 3 skipped`) after removing compatibility paths.
## 2026-03-12 20:12:28 +0000

Debugged and fixed a real `aivm code --mode git .` failure where guest repo initialization attempted to create host-mirrored absolute paths (for example `/home/joncrall/...`) inside the VM and failed with permission denied for the VM user. Root cause was default guest destination derivation being shared-mode-centric (`guest_dst = host_src`) even in git mode. I updated attachment resolution so git mode defaults to a VM-user-writable path under `/home/<vm-user>/...`, and added auto-migration for legacy git attachments that had saved the old host-mirror guest path (`guest_dst == host_src`) when no explicit `--guest_dst` is provided.

Reflection/state of mind: this was a good product-contract correction because git mode should not rely on guest root path creation to function. The failure trace made it clear the issue was deterministic default-path policy, not flaky SSH/Git behavior.

Uncertainties/risks: path migration heuristic intentionally targets the narrow legacy case (`saved guest_dst equals host source path`). It should be low risk, but if someone intentionally set that exact path and made it writable in guest, the new logic may remap unless they set explicit `--guest_dst`/saved path differently.

Tradeoffs and what might break: git mode default guest path no longer exactly mirrors host absolute path. This is safer and more portable across differing host/guest usernames, but it is a behavioral change users may notice when they relied on exact path identity.

What I am confident about: added tests for new git default destination and legacy migration path, docs now clarify shared-vs-git default path behavior, and full suite is green (`136 passed, 3 skipped`).
## 2026-03-12 20:30:32 +0000

Applied a focused UX/logging tweak for sudo transparency: when a sudo intent is read-only, the user-visible planning log now explicitly says "read-only" instead of a generic "privileged command(s)" label. State-changing intents are labeled as such. This change is localized to `aivm/util.py::_ensure_sudo_ready` and does not alter execution policy; it only improves clarity in logs shown before sudo execution/prompt.

Reflection/state of mind: this is a small change but materially improves trust and debuggability because users can now distinguish probe-style elevation from mutating elevation at a glance in the same place they approve commands.

Uncertainties/risks: none functionally expected; this is message text only. The only possible impact is downstream tests/tools that grep exact prior log phrases.

Tradeoffs and what might break: wording changed from generic to mode-specific. If external scripts parse these exact log lines, they may need updates.

What I am confident about: targeted helper/util tests and full suite remain green (`136 passed, 3 skipped`).
## 2026-03-12 20:35:37 +0000

Fixed a real signature mismatch in saved-attachment restore flow: `_restore_saved_vm_attachments()` called `_record_attachment(...)` without required keyword-only `mode`, which surfaced at runtime as a warning and skipped persistence for restored attachments. Added `mode=aligned.mode` at the callsite and strengthened the existing restore test to monkeypatch `_record_attachment` with a strict keyword-only signature and assert mode is recorded for the secondary restored folder.

Reflection/state of mind: this is exactly the kind of bug that can hide under broad exception handling and only show up as operational warning noise. Tightening the test seam to enforce function signature use is the right defense.

Uncertainties/risks: low risk; change is localized and aligns call arguments with declared signature. Existing behavior should only improve (restored attachments now persist correctly instead of warning).

Tradeoffs and what might break: none expected beyond exposing similar latent issues if other tests adopt stricter monkeypatch signatures.

What I am confident about: targeted tests and full suite are green (`136 passed, 3 skipped`). I also checked local static type-check command availability; `ty` is not installed in this environment, so no type-check pass ran here.
## 2026-03-12 20:40:52 +0000

Completed the remaining `ty check aivm` cleanup after enabling local `ty`. Fixed two categories: (1) function signature alignment where `_restore_saved_vm_attachments` accepted `None` callsite for `primary_attachment` by updating annotation to `ResolvedAttachment | None`, and (2) dict key lookup typing issues in config lint by adding explicit `cast(dict[str, object], item)` after runtime `isinstance(item, dict)` guards in the `networks` and `vms` loops.

Reflection/state of mind: this is a good reminder that dynamic-style data validation code benefits from small explicit casts so static checkers can follow control flow. The runtime behavior was already correct; the typing intent just needed to be made explicit.

Uncertainties/risks: low; changes are type-surface only and preserve runtime logic.

Tradeoffs and what might break: introducing `typing.cast` adds minor verbosity but improves static confidence and future refactor safety.

What I am confident about: `ty check aivm` now reports `All checks passed!`, and full tests remain green (`136 passed, 3 skipped`).
## 2026-03-12 21:14:26 +0000

Documented virtiofs device-slot exhaustion as a major current limitation and added a dedicated future-design note for scalable host/guest folder sharing alternatives. I added explicit user-facing language in README and workflows docs that shared-mode folder count is constrained by VM device topology (PCI/PCIe slots), including concrete failure phrasing (`No more available PCI slots`) and current operational mitigations (use git mode, detach unused shares, split across VMs). I also updated the design contract to capture this limitation and linked a new future design note under `dev/design/future/flexible-folder-sharing.md` for potential backend directions (sshfs/network-backed/sync-based/multiplexed workspace).

Reflection/state of mind: this is the right place to make the limitation explicit now rather than treating it as an incidental runtime error. Users need an upfront model of why folder attach scaling fails, and maintainers need a stable design placeholder for alternative approaches.

Uncertainties/risks: the future design note is intentionally exploratory and not a committed roadmap; if we pick one backend direction later, some candidate options may be dropped.

Tradeoffs and what might break: none runtime; docs-only change. The only tradeoff is acknowledging a hard limitation more prominently, which can feel heavier but improves expectation setting.

What I am confident about: the limitation is now documented in both user workflow docs and design-level contract notes, and future work has a concrete file/location to accumulate backend design ideas.
## 2026-03-12 21:48:08 +0000

Added a VM status line for virtiofs slot pressure visibility. `render_status(...)` now reports `VM virtiofs slots` alongside existing `VM shared folders`, with current usage count and an explicit `available unknown (VM PCI/PCIe topology dependent)` qualifier. This gives operators immediate signal about share-device growth without implying a fake precise capacity number.

Reflection/state of mind: this is a pragmatic transparency improvement. Exact remaining capacity is topology-dependent and non-trivial to compute robustly from generic libvirt XML, so reporting used-count plus clear uncertainty is better than either silence or brittle pseudo-precision.

Uncertainties/risks: users may still ask for exact remaining capacity; we should treat that as future enhancement requiring deeper domain-XML/controller occupancy modeling.

Tradeoffs and what might break: one extra status line in normal output; low risk. Any tests depending on exact status text ordering may need updates.

What I am confident about: added regression coverage for the new status line and full suite remains green (`137 passed, 3 skipped`).
## 2026-03-12 21:53:26 +0000

Removed the recently added `VM virtiofs slots` status line after product feedback that usage-only without remaining-capacity estimation is not useful enough in default status output. Reverted the corresponding status test additions. Status output now remains focused on existing share mapping presence/count messaging without a separate slots line.

Reflection/state of mind: this is a reasonable UX rollback. Even though the line was technically accurate, it added noise without giving users the actionable "how many left" value they want.

Uncertainties/risks: none runtime; output-only change.

Tradeoffs and what might break: users lose immediate visibility of raw used-count in a dedicated line, but that information is still available via shared-folder status/detail outputs.

What I am confident about: status-focused tests and full suite are green (`136 passed, 3 skipped`).
## 2026-03-12 22:04:10 +0000

Expanded `dev/design/future/flexible-folder-sharing.md` with a concrete bind-mount-based single-export strategy. The new section describes why host symlinks are insufficient for arbitrary external paths, how a per-VM shared-root plus one persistent virtiofs mapping could work, rough attach/detach steps, and operational/safety concerns (reboot recovery, stale mounts, partial failure cleanup, and sudo-mutation boundaries).

Reflection/state of mind: this is the most actionable follow-up to the virtiofs-slot limitation because it preserves a single virtiofs device while still enabling many host sources. Documenting it concretely now should reduce design drift later.

Uncertainties/risks: guest destination mapping policy (guest symlink vs guest bind mount) remains open and should be decided with permission/safety ergonomics in mind.

Tradeoffs and what might break: none runtime; design-doc only.

What I am confident about: the future-design doc now includes a technically viable path that directly addresses the device-slot bottleneck.
## 2026-03-12 22:22:52 +0000

Implemented the `shared-root` attachment mode end-to-end and switched default new-attachment mode selection to `shared-root` when `--mode` is omitted. Core changes are in `aivm/cli/vm.py`: completed detach/session support for `shared-root`, added shared-root restore path coverage for saved attachments, introduced `_ensure_attachment_available_in_guest(...)` to localize mode-specific guest activation logic, and tightened `_restore_saved_vm_attachments(...)` so shared-only mapping probes are skipped when irrelevant. I also updated mode/help/docs text in `README.rst` and `docs/source/workflows.rst` to explicitly document mode behavior, including `aivm code --mode git .` semantics and required detach+reattach on mode mismatch.

Reflection/state of mind: I considered a broader attachment-backend abstraction layer, but chose a bounded refactor (single guest-activation helper + targeted branch cleanup) because it reduces duplication in the highest-churn call paths without introducing framework overhead or touching unrelated lifecycle modules. This keeps momentum while still improving extensibility for future backends.

Uncertainties/risks: `shared-root` still relies on host/guest bind-mount operations and therefore inherits mount lifecycle edge cases (stale mounts, missing source paths at restore time, partial cleanup after interrupted operations). Another risk is mixed historical attachment records with missing tags; detach now warns and continues best-effort cleanup rather than failing hard.

Tradeoffs and what might break: default mode behavior for *new* attachments changed from `shared` to `shared-root`, which is intentional but user-visible. Existing attachment mode records are preserved and reused, so behavioral drift should be limited to first-time folder attaches. The small helper abstraction avoids broad churn but leaves some mode branching still explicit in orchestration paths by design.

What I am confident about: added/updated regression coverage in `tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py`, `tests/test_cli_vm_detach.py`, and `tests/test_cli_vm_update.py`; targeted suites pass and full test suite is green (`141 passed, 3 skipped`). Static check also passes (`ty check aivm`: `All checks passed!`).
## 2026-03-12 23:16:08 +0000

Extended opt-in end-to-end coverage so the newly introduced attachment-mode behavior is exercised in real CLI workflows. In `tests/test_e2e_full.py`, after VM bring-up I now assert that default attach (no mode) persists `shared-root`, verify explicit mode mismatch (`--mode git` on an existing non-git attachment) fails with the expected error text, then run detach + explicit shared-root reattach and assert store state across each step. In `tests/test_e2e_bootstrap_context.py`, I updated the guest-side bootstrap script to run the same operational sequence (`attach` default, mismatched attach expected-fail, `detach`, explicit `attach --mode shared-root`) so nested host-context exercises cover those branches too.

Reflection/state of mind: this is the right place to validate behavior contracts because unit tests already prove internal branching, while e2e now confirms user-facing command sequencing and failure semantics across real subprocess boundaries.

Uncertainties/risks: these tests remain environment-gated (`AIVM_E2E*`) and are skipped by default, so they protect behavior when run in capable environments but do not run in every local fast cycle. Also, mismatch assertion currently checks error substring in merged CLI output, which is robust enough today but still text-dependent.

Tradeoffs and what might break: added a few CLI calls to the full/bootstrap e2e flows, increasing runtime slightly when e2e is enabled. The additional assertions are intentional to catch regressions in mode-default and detach/reattach requirements.

What I am confident about: parse/skip behavior remains clean (`pytest -q tests/test_e2e_full.py tests/test_e2e_bootstrap_context.py tests/test_e2e_nested.py` -> skipped as expected without e2e env), and full suite is still green (`141 passed, 3 skipped`).
## 2026-03-13 00:29:33 +0000

Focused on stabilizing the new `shared-root` attach flow under real e2e conditions (`run_e2e_tests.sh`). The initial rerun exposed a remaining bind-source comparison bug in `_ensure_shared_root_host_bind(...)`: `findmnt -o SOURCE` can return device-backed bind source strings like `/dev/vda1[/abs/source]`, and our previous normalization only handled `/src[/sub]` forms. I added `_mount_source_compare_candidates(...)` in `aivm/cli/vm.py` to compare all relevant candidates (raw, prefix, bracket suffix), then added a regression test in `tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py` for the `/dev/...[/path]` case.

Reflection/state of mind: this felt like a classic “unit tests were close but not complete” issue. The earlier fix was directionally right, but e2e revealed the real-world `findmnt` shape we missed. I’m satisfied the comparison logic now models the kernel/util-linux output variants we actually see on host systems.

Uncertainties/risks: detach still logs a warning when host-side bind unmount is busy in the e2e flow; behavior is currently best-effort and non-fatal by design, but mount lifecycle cleanup remains an area to watch if we tighten semantics later.

Tradeoffs and what might break: normalization is now more permissive in what it accepts as “same source”, which avoids false remount churn. The risk is low, but if `findmnt` emits an unexpected bracket format that is not a bind path, we could match more broadly than intended; current candidate handling still requires canonical path equality with the resolved source.

What I am confident about: targeted regression tests pass (`pytest -q tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py -k "shared_root_host_bind"` -> `3 passed`), and full end-to-end script is green (`./run_e2e_tests.sh` -> `2 passed`).
## 2026-03-13 18:37:22 +0000

Adjusted `_upsert_host_git_remote(...)` in `aivm/cli/vm.py` so confirmation purpose text is action-specific: it now says `Register` when adding a missing remote and `Update` when changing an existing remote URL. I also added assertions in `tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py` to verify both paths and the exact purpose wording.

Reflection/state of mind: this was a small but worthwhile UX precision fix. The previous prompt was technically correct but vague at decision time; tightening the action wording makes privileged/external-file confirmation clearer without altering behavior.

Uncertainties/risks: low risk, primarily around test brittleness from exact purpose-string assertions if prompt wording changes again intentionally.

Tradeoffs and what might break: prompts are now more explicit and include previous URL during update; this increases clarity but couples tests to message text. Runtime behavior for git remote management is unchanged.

What I am confident about: local coverage for both register/update flows is in place and the full attach test module passes (`pytest -q tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py` -> `16 passed`).
## 2026-03-13 18:40:05 +0000

Refactored `run_cmd(...)` logging in `aivm/util.py` to bind `local_log = log.opt(depth=1)` once and reuse it for all log calls within the function, replacing repeated `log.opt(depth=1)` invocations. This is a readability/maintainability cleanup with no behavior change intended.

Reflection/state of mind: this is a small consistency improvement that reduces repeated boilerplate and makes the function easier to scan. I avoided broader logging changes because depth handling is subtle and this adjustment preserves the existing depth option as-is.

Uncertainties/risks: low risk; main risk would be unintended callsite-depth differences, but using the same configured logger object should preserve emitted caller context.

Tradeoffs and what might break: no functional command-execution behavior changed; only logging call sites were rewritten to use a local alias. If downstream tooling depends on exact logger-object internals rather than emitted output, that tooling could be sensitive, but that scenario is unlikely.

What I am confident about: syntax check passes (`python -m py_compile aivm/util.py`), and the refactor is localized to `run_cmd(...)`.
## 2026-03-13 18:41:36 +0000

Extended the same logging-localization cleanup to `_ensure_sudo_ready(...)` in `aivm/util.py`, introducing `local_log = log.opt(depth=2)` and reusing it for repeated info logs. This follows the same pattern as the prior `run_cmd(...)` update and leaves callsite depth explicit per function.

Reflection/state of mind: this was a straightforward follow-through on consistency. Keeping both utility functions aligned makes the logging style easier to maintain and reduces repeated option-object construction noise.

Uncertainties/risks: very low; primary concern remains preserving callsite depth semantics, which should be unchanged because the same opt depth is used.

Tradeoffs and what might break: no command behavior changes; only internal logging expression style changed. If anyone relied on exact source formatting (unlikely), that would differ, but emitted log meaning should remain the same.

What I am confident about: `aivm/util.py` compiles cleanly (`python -m py_compile aivm/util.py`) and there are now only two `log.opt(depth=...)` sites in-module, both centralized local aliases per function.
## 2026-03-13 18:54:21 +0000

Adjusted `_git_current_branch(...)` in `aivm/cli/vm.py` to use `run_cmd(..., check=False)` so branch discovery is treated as probe logging (debug-level `RUN:`) instead of imperative logging (info-level). Added explicit non-zero exit handling that raises a focused RuntimeError including repo path and git output. Also added unit tests in `tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py` for successful named-branch detection and failure-path error reporting.

Reflection/state of mind: this aligns command logging with intent: branch lookup is introspection, not a state-changing step. I kept the change narrowly scoped to avoid broader behavioral shifts in other git flows.

Uncertainties/risks: low risk; only message text changed for git command failures in this specific helper. Detached-HEAD semantics remain unchanged.

Tradeoffs and what might break: we lose automatic `CmdError` wrapping from `check=True` in favor of manual RuntimeError shaping, which is intentional for better UX/context. Any tests that expected prior exception wording would need adjustment.

What I am confident about: targeted and module tests pass (`pytest -q tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py -k "git_current_branch or upsert_host_git_remote"` -> `4 passed`; `pytest -q tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py` -> `18 passed`).
## 2026-03-13 18:56:28 +0000

Updated `_upsert_host_git_remote(...)` in `aivm/cli/vm.py` to better match probe logging semantics and clarify intent. Specifically, I changed the git common-dir lookup (`rev-parse --git-common-dir`) to `check=False` with explicit error handling, so this introspection step logs at debug instead of info and returns a clearer contextual RuntimeError when the repo is invalid. I also added a docstring that explains what “upsert” means in plain language (update if present, register if missing) and what the tuple return value represents.

Reflection/state of mind: this was the right follow-up to the earlier branch-probe adjustment; keeping probe-vs-imperative logging consistent across helper functions makes command logs less noisy and more semantically accurate.

Uncertainties/risks: low risk; the main user-visible change is exception wording for invalid/non-git repo handling in this helper.

Tradeoffs and what might break: replacing implicit `CmdError` from `check=True` with a shaped RuntimeError improves readability and context, but any tests or consumers expecting the prior raw exception text could need updates.

What I am confident about: added regression coverage for invalid repo handling in `tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py`; targeted and full attach tests pass (`pytest -q tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py -k "upsert_host_git_remote or git_current_branch"` -> `5 passed`; `pytest -q tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py` -> `19 passed`).
## 2026-03-13 19:02:01 +0000

Addressed a noisy/unnecessary store write in the `aivm code ... --mode git` attachment-prep flow. In `_record_attachment(...)` (`aivm/cli/vm.py`), I now snapshot the loaded store, apply network/vm/attachment upserts, and only call `save_store(...)` if the store actually changed. When no changes are detected, it logs a debug "already up to date" message and returns the existing config path without rewriting `config.toml`.

Reflection/state of mind: this is an important ergonomics fix because repeated no-op runs should not look state-changing. The previous unconditional save blurred signal in verbose logs and caused needless disk writes.

Uncertainties/risks: low risk; equality-based no-op detection depends on dataclass value equality, which is appropriate here but should be revisited if mutable/non-deterministic fields are introduced into store records.

Tradeoffs and what might break: one fewer INFO log line (`Writing config store ...`) on no-op runs; workflows relying on file mtime bumps from repeated no-op commands will no longer get them.

What I am confident about: added regression coverage in `tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py` to assert `save_store` is not called when record content is unchanged; targeted and full attach tests pass (`pytest -q tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py -k "record_attachment_skips_save_when_unchanged or upsert_host_git_remote or git_current_branch"` -> `6 passed`; `pytest -q tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py` -> `20 passed`).
## 2026-03-13 19:14:37 +0000

Implemented attachment access-mode plumbing with a new `--access` flag (`rw`/`ro`) across `aivm code`, `aivm ssh`, and `aivm attach`, and persisted the setting in store attachments (`access` field, default `rw`). The resolver now treats access similarly to mode for existing mappings (saved-value reuse when omitted, mismatch requires detach+reattach when explicitly changed). Per request, `ro` is currently implemented only for `shared` mode; requesting `ro` with `shared-root` or `git` now raises `NotImplementedError`.

On mount behavior, `ensure_share_mounted(...)` now accepts `read_only` and mounts `virtiofs` with `-o ro` when requested, plus remounts existing mountpoints to match desired `ro/rw` state. Shared-mode guest mount calls now pass `read_only` from resolved attachment access. I also updated list output to show attachment access and config-lint allowed keys to include `attachments[].access`.

Reflection/state of mind: this was a good scoped increment. I intentionally avoided broad RO semantics across shared-root and git until there is a clear policy for host bind/export enforcement and guest write semantics.

Uncertainties/risks: `shared` RO currently enforces at guest mount/remount level; if stronger host-side enforcement is desired, further libvirt/device-level constraints may be needed.

Tradeoffs and what might break: store serialization now writes `access = "..."` for attachments, which is backward-compatible on load but changes config file text output and diffs. Existing automation parsing attachment blocks should tolerate the added key.

What I am confident about: focused regression coverage was added for access resolution/mismatch and RO mount command generation; affected suites pass (`pytest -q tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py tests/test_cli_vm_update.py tests/test_vm_helpers.py tests/test_store.py tests/test_cli_config_lint.py` -> `61 passed`), and changed modules compile cleanly.
## 2026-03-13 19:19:30 +0000

Added a new `aivm help completion` subcommand (`aivm/cli/help.py`) to provide explicit shell-completion setup instructions for argcomplete/scriptconfig users. It supports `--shell {bash,zsh,fish}` (auto-detect defaults) and prints shell-specific commands for one-time activation and persistence, including the `python -m pip install argcomplete` prerequisite and `register-python-argcomplete` usage. I also wired this command into the help modal tree, updated docs references in `README.rst` and `docs/source/workflows.rst`, and added tests for output and invalid-shell validation.

Reflection/state of mind: this is the right UX for this project. Installing shell hooks automatically during `pip install` is brittle and intrusive because package installers cannot safely mutate per-user shell rc files in a predictable way across shells/environments.

Uncertainties/risks: minimal runtime risk; the main variability is user environment differences (missing `register-python-argcomplete`, shell startup nuances), which the help output now calls out directly.

Tradeoffs and what might break: command tree output gained one new line (`aivm help completion ...`), so tests asserting exact help-tree entries needed updating. No VM/runtime behavior changed.

What I am confident about: updated tests pass (`pytest -q tests/test_cli_helpers.py tests/test_cli_dryrun.py` -> `24 passed`) and touched CLI modules compile (`python -m py_compile aivm/cli/help.py aivm/cli/main.py`).
## 2026-03-13 19:23:30 +0000

Added the requested global argcomplete note to `aivm help completion`. The command output now includes an explicit optional system-wide setup line using `activate-global-python-argcomplete` (resolved from PATH when available), alongside the existing per-shell user-level setup steps.

Reflection/state of mind: this small addition improves discoverability for users who want one-time global completion behavior across Python CLIs without changing default safety assumptions.

Uncertainties/risks: global activation behavior can vary by distro/shell integration; the help text labels it as optional and keeps the local per-shell path as primary guidance.

Tradeoffs and what might break: none functionally; output text is longer and tests that assert help text were updated accordingly.

What I am confident about: targeted help-completion tests pass (`pytest -q tests/test_cli_helpers.py -k "help_completion"` -> `2 passed`).
## 2026-03-13 19:33:41 +0000

Extended read-only access support to `shared-root` mode (while keeping `git` as not implemented for RO). In `aivm/cli/vm.py`, `_resolve_attachment(...)` now allows `access=ro` for `shared-root` and only raises `NotImplementedError` for `mode=git`. I also updated `_ensure_shared_root_guest_bind(...)` to enforce desired bind mount access inside the guest via `mount -o remount,bind,ro|rw`, including initial bind + remount and reconciliation when already mounted.

Reflection/state of mind: this is a pragmatic increment that aligns with the requested scope and avoids overreaching into full host-side RO export policy changes. It keeps the access-mode contract consistent with current architecture.

Uncertainties/risks: `shared-root` still exposes the shared-root mount path inside guest, so access control is currently enforced at the requested guest destination bind mount rather than a stronger per-export host-side policy.

Tradeoffs and what might break: behavior changed for `--access ro --mode shared-root` from hard failure to success; tests expecting the previous NotImplemented behavior were updated accordingly. `git` RO remains intentionally unsupported.

What I am confident about: added regression coverage in `tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py` for (1) shared-root RO resolution accepted, (2) git RO still not implemented, and (3) shared-root guest bind script includes `remount,bind,ro`; attach and update suites pass (`pytest -q tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py` -> `25 passed`; `pytest -q tests/test_cli_vm_update.py` -> `11 passed`).
## 2026-03-13 19:36:28 +0000

Follow-up fix for a real user failure in `aivm attach ... --mode shared-root --access ro`: guest-side bind setup failed with `mkdir: ... Transport endpoint is not connected` when a stale/broken mountpoint already existed at the destination. I updated `_ensure_shared_root_guest_bind(...)` to recover from this condition by retrying `mkdir -p` with explicit error capture and, on transport-endpoint errors, performing `umount -l <guest_dst>` before a second `mkdir` attempt.

Reflection/state of mind: this was a good real-world hardening pass. The prior flow assumed destination mkdir would always be safe before remount checks, which is false under disconnected mount edge cases.

Uncertainties/risks: lazy unmount fallback is intentionally scoped to the known transport-endpoint error string; different localized/system-specific error text variants may still bypass the recovery path.

Tradeoffs and what might break: the guest-side shell script is more complex and now conditionally uses `grep`/`printf` in the remote command path. This improves robustness but adds parsing/command dependencies that were not previously exercised in this branch.

What I am confident about: regression tests remain green for attach/update suites (`pytest -q tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py tests/test_cli_vm_update.py` -> `36 passed`), and updated modules compile.
## 2026-03-13 19:42:00 +0000

Addressed a second real-world shared-root attach failure: host-side bind reconciliation could fail with `umount: target is busy` in `_ensure_shared_root_host_bind(...)` when replacing an existing mountpoint. I changed this path to attempt normal `umount` first (non-fatal probe), then fall back to `umount -l` for known transient/busy cases (`target is busy` and `transport endpoint is not connected`) before rebinding the desired source.

Reflection/state of mind: this complements the earlier guest-side stale-endpoint fix; both host and guest paths now handle common mount lifecycle hazards that show up in iterative attach workflows.

Uncertainties/risks: lazy unmount can defer actual cleanup until references drain, so if another process continuously pins the old mount, behavior may still require manual operator intervention.

Tradeoffs and what might break: recovery path is more permissive for busy mounts, prioritizing forward progress for attach operations over strict immediate unmount guarantees.

What I am confident about: added regression coverage (`test_shared_root_host_bind_lazy_unmounts_busy_target`) and attach/update suites remain green (`pytest -q tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py tests/test_cli_vm_update.py` -> `37 passed`), with compile checks passing.
## 2026-03-13 21:07:47 +0000

Investigated a user report that `aivm attach .` in `shared-root` mode appeared to skip guest-side reconciliation when the VM was already running. I traced the attach flow in `VMAttachCLI.main(...)` and confirmed `_ensure_attachment_available_in_guest(...)` is invoked under `if vm_running:`; there is already regression coverage (`test_vm_attach_shared_root_running_ensures_guest_ready`) that asserts this call path. The ambiguity came from default-verbosity output: the reconciliation path had no info-level marker unless retries/errors occurred.

I added explicit `INFO` logs in two places in `aivm/cli/vm.py`: (1) right before the running-VM guest reconcile call in `VMAttachCLI.main(...)`, and (2) at entry to `_ensure_shared_root_guest_bind(...)` including token/destination/access. This makes the runtime behavior observable in normal logs and reduces false negatives when users diagnose attach behavior.

Reflection/state of mind: this felt like a visibility/operability issue rather than a missing branch. The code path was present, but the absence of positive confirmation made it easy to infer it was skipped. I prioritized instrumentation over structural churn because the control flow already had targeted tests and recent hardening.

Uncertainties/risks: low code risk, but info logs are now a bit more chatty for successful attaches on running VMs. If users find this noisy, we may revisit log level or wording.

Tradeoffs and what might break: no behavior change in mount mechanics, only observability change. Any tests asserting exact CLI/log text could need updates if they start checking this path in the future.

What I am confident about: attach/update regression suites pass after the edit (`pytest -q tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py tests/test_cli_vm_update.py` -> `37 passed`).
## 2026-03-13 21:27:23 +0000

Investigated a live failure after adding shared-root verification: `findmnt -o SOURCE --target <guest_dst>` returned `none`, causing false-negative verification (`expected /mnt/aivm-shared/<token>, actual none`) even though this can be a valid representation for bind mounts on some stacks (notably when binding from virtiofs/fuse-backed paths). I updated `_ensure_shared_root_guest_bind(...)` to pair SOURCE with ROOT checks.

Implementation details: the guest-side script now captures both SOURCE and ROOT for current/final mount state. A mount is accepted when either SOURCE exactly matches the expected source path, or SOURCE is `none` and ROOT matches the expected token root (`/<token>`). This logic is applied both before deciding whether to unmount an existing mount and during final verification. Verification error output now includes expected/actual ROOT for easier diagnosis.

Reflection/state of mind: this was a useful correction to over-strict validation. The previous check prevented silent mismatch, but it assumed SOURCE formatting was stable across filesystems and mount helpers. The new check keeps correctness while acknowledging real kernel/userspace variability.

Uncertainties/risks: ROOT formatting across environments may still vary in edge cases; if an environment reports an unexpected ROOT form, we may need a small normalization helper.

Tradeoffs and what might break: verification is slightly more complex and now depends on `findmnt -o ROOT`, but this should be broadly available where existing `findmnt` usage already works.

What I am confident about: targeted suites remain green (`pytest -q tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py tests/test_cli_vm_update.py` -> `37 passed`), and I added an assertion to keep ROOT-check logic present in the generated guest script.
## 2026-03-14 18:43:51 +0000

Handled another shared-root guest verification edge case from real logs: `findmnt -o SOURCE` returned `none` and `findmnt -o ROOT` returned empty for the destination after bind, which made the previous check still fail despite an apparently valid path state. I updated `_ensure_shared_root_guest_bind(...)` to fall back to device+inode equivalence checks (`stat -Lc %d:%i`) when findmnt metadata is ambiguous.

Behavioral change: both the pre-existing-mount reconciliation branch and final verification branch now accept the mount as correct if either SOURCE matches expected directly, SOURCE=none with expected ROOT, or SOURCE=none with matching source/destination stat signature. On failure, diagnostics now optionally print expected/actual stat signatures to make guest-level investigation easier.

Reflection/state of mind: this was a pragmatic reliability fix under heterogeneous util-linux behavior. The intent remains strict correctness, but verification now uses multiple independent signals instead of a single metadata field that is not stable across systems.

Uncertainties/risks: stat-based equivalence assumes destination mountpoint root inode should match source root inode for the bind case, which is true for normal bind mounts but could be surprising in unusual filesystem/proxy scenarios.

Tradeoffs and what might break: remote script complexity increased again; however this is localized and test-covered. There is modest extra command overhead (`stat`) only in ambiguous SOURCE=none paths.

What I am confident about: attach/update tests and compile checks pass after the change (`pytest -q tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py tests/test_cli_vm_update.py` -> `37 passed`; `python -m py_compile aivm/cli/vm.py tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py` succeeds).
## 2026-03-14 18:49:06 +0000

Fixed a sudo-confirmation regression where choosing `[a]ll` only suppressed the next confirmation block, then prompts returned later in the same command. Root cause was in `_confirm_sudo_block(...)`: it always re-armed sudo intent with `sticky=False`, which erased prior sticky-all state whenever a new block armed intent.

I changed `_confirm_sudo_block(...)` to snapshot current sticky state via `sudo_intent_auto_yes()` and preserve it when re-arming (`sticky=sticky_all`). Effective-yes computation still honors explicit `--yes`, `--yes-sudo`, sticky-all, and read-only auto-approve policy; the key change is that sticky-all now survives across multiple confirm blocks during one CLI run.

Tests: updated existing sticky expectation and added a regression test for read-action blocks preserving sticky-all in `tests/test_cli_helpers.py`. Ran `pytest -q tests/test_cli_helpers.py tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py tests/test_cli_vm_update.py` (`60 passed`) and compile check for touched files.

Reflection/state of mind: this was a straightforward state-lifetime bug that matched user telemetry perfectly. The fix is intentionally minimal and localized to avoid changing confirmation semantics beyond preserving what the user explicitly asked for with `[a]ll`.

Uncertainties/risks: low. Behavior when users never choose `[a]ll` is unchanged; behavior with `[a]ll` is now consistent across the full command execution.
## 2026-03-16 14:48:09 +0000

Addressed an e2e instability where shared-root attach reconciliation could appear to hang (20s+ silent stretches) and trigger outer harness timeouts. The logs showed long gaps around guest SSH mount commands after VM readiness checks. I hardened guest-side mount calls in both `ensure_share_mounted(...)` and `_ensure_shared_root_guest_bind(...)`.

Changes made:
- Switched guest-side privileged commands in these remote scripts from `sudo` to `sudo -n` so they fail fast instead of blocking on password prompts.
- Added SSH non-interactive/connect controls (`batch_mode=True`, `connect_timeout=5`) to these remote calls.
- Added `run_cmd(..., timeout=20)` for both calls to bound per-attempt latency and surface a concrete timeout error instead of hanging indefinitely.

I added/updated assertions in unit tests to lock in the new behavior (presence of `sudo -n` and timeout kwargs), then ran focused suites: `tests/test_vm_helpers.py`, `tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py`, `tests/test_cli_vm_update.py`, and `tests/test_cli_helpers.py` (`81 passed`). A direct run of `tests/test_e2e_bootstrap_context.py` is skipped in this environment, so I could not locally reproduce that full e2e workflow end-to-end.

Reflection/state of mind: this is a pragmatic hardening pass that trades potential single-attempt patience for deterministic failure semantics and clearer diagnostics, which is preferable in CI/e2e contexts where silent stalls are costly.

Uncertainties/risks: if guest command execution legitimately needs more than 20 seconds in some environments, we may need a configurable timeout knob, but with retries in `ensure_share_mounted` this should still be robust for readiness races.

Follow-up on probe wording: I initially introduced an implicit mapping of `sudo + check=False` to read-only mode in `run_cmd`, then reverted that assumption based on user feedback. The final approach is explicit intent marking only.

Implementation details:
- `run_cmd` now supports an explicit `sudo_action` override (`read`/`modify`) but does not infer from `check=False`.
- I marked probe-heavy sudo calls with `sudo_action='read'` in key lifecycle paths (`_sudo_path_exists`, `_sudo_file_exists`, `_vm_defined`, `wait_for_ip` probes, `vm_status`), plus network/share probe calls where appropriate.
- I kept destructive `check=False` calls explicitly marked `sudo_action='modify'` (destroy/undefine/rm/virt-install first-pass, detach-device, unmount/rmdir paths).
- Added the requested e2e visibility line after the expected attachment-mode mismatch failure assertion in `tests/test_e2e_full.py`.

Reflection/state of mind: explicitness is cleaner here. Probe-vs-modify semantics are domain-level intent, not something that should be guessed from `check` behavior. This preserves control and keeps logging trustworthy.

Risk/tradeoff: requires callsite discipline; missing `sudo_action` at a new probe callsite can still inherit broader action context and produce noisy wording. However, this is preferable to a silent global assumption.

Validation: `pytest -q tests/test_util.py tests/test_vm_helpers.py tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py tests/test_cli_vm_update.py tests/test_cli_helpers.py tests/test_e2e_full.py` -> `89 passed, 1 skipped`; compile checks for touched files pass.

Reviewed and reduced sudo logging redundancy after a user report that privileged probe loops were too noisy. The duplicated pattern in loops was: `INFO Planned ...`, `DEBUG Running with sudo ...`, and `DEBUG RUN: sudo ...` for every probe. I kept the execution-visible `RUN:` line and adjusted verbosity so we still satisfy policy intent while reducing repetitive output.

Implementation details:
- In `aivm/util.py::_ensure_sudo_ready(...)`, I now log `Planned privileged ...` at `INFO` when confirmation is required or when action is state-changing.
- For auto-approved read-only probes, I demoted that `Planned ...` line to `TRACE` to avoid flooding polling loops.
- In `aivm/util.py::run_cmd(...)`, I demoted the extra `Running with sudo: ...` line to `TRACE`; `RUN: ...` remains the primary visible execution line.

Reflection/state of mind: this felt like an observability calibration problem, not a correctness bug. The important part is preserving trust in what command actually ran while avoiding log spam that obscures meaningful events.

Uncertainties/risks: callers that rely on `INFO` for every read-only sudo probe will now need `TRACE` if they want per-probe planning detail. I think this is acceptable because state-changing and approval-gated intent remains prominently visible.

Tradeoffs and what might break: no command behavior changes, only log-level changes. Any tests asserting exact log levels/messages for read-only probe planning may need updates.

What I am confident about: focused suites covering util + CLI helper/attach/update behavior remain green after the change (`pytest -q tests/test_util.py tests/test_cli_helpers.py tests/test_vm_helpers.py tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py tests/test_cli_vm_update.py` -> `89 passed`).
## 2026-03-16 16:23:14 +0000

Worked on a safety regression surfaced by user logs: running `aivm code .` in a new directory triggered automatic restore of saved shared-root attachments, and some restore paths used `umount` / `umount -l` on mismatched existing bind targets. That can disrupt unrelated active workflows inside a running VM.

Implementation details:
- Added a new guard in `aivm/cli/vm.py::_ensure_shared_root_host_bind(...)` via `allow_disruptive_rebind` (default `True` for explicit/user-invoked flows).
- When `allow_disruptive_rebind=False` and target is already mounted to a different source, the function now raises a clear `RuntimeError` instead of unmounting/rebinding.
- `_restore_saved_vm_attachments(...)` now calls `_ensure_shared_root_host_bind(..., allow_disruptive_rebind=False)` so background/automatic restore avoids forced/lazy unmounts.
- Added a specific warning path in restore to explain it skipped the attachment to avoid disruption.
- Updated `docs/source/design.rst` operational policy: automatic/background reconciliation must avoid disruptive mount operations and require explicit user action for risky repair.
- Added regression test `test_shared_root_host_bind_refuses_disruptive_rebind_when_disabled`.

Reflection/state of mind: this was the right place to tighten safety boundaries. Auto-restore should be conservative because users may have long-running in-guest work that the host cannot reliably classify as safe to disrupt.

Uncertainties/risks: with this guard, some stale shared-root host bind mismatches remain unrepaired during restore and will require explicit user reconcile (attach/detach). That is intentional, but may surprise users who expected fully self-healing behavior.

Tradeoffs and what might break: no destructive auto-fix in restore means fewer accidental disruptions, but potentially more warnings and manual follow-up. Explicit attach flows still allow disruptive repair when the user directly requests it.

What I am confident about: targeted suites pass after the change (`pytest -q tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py tests/test_cli_vm_update.py tests/test_cli_helpers.py tests/test_util.py` -> `69 passed`) and touched files compile.
## 2026-03-18 15:34:11 +0000

Worked on a fresh-machine bootstrap regression in the shortcut startup path (`aivm ssh .` / `aivm code .`). The user report was very specific and helpful: top-level parse logs showed `yes=False`, but deeper bootstrap logs claimed `--yes was provided`, which caused missing dependency detection to skip the normal install prompt and then fail later when `sudo virsh ...` ran against an unprepared host.

Root cause was in `aivm/cli/vm.py::_prepare_attached_session(...)`. After the initial "No managed VM found for this folder" confirmation, the code unconditionally called `InitCLI.main(... yes=True, defaults=True)` and `VMCreateCLI.main(... yes=True)`. That flattened the user's actual intent into global auto-approval for the rest of bootstrap, so nested prompt-aware helpers behaved as if the user had explicitly passed `--yes` on the command line.

I changed that handoff to preserve the original top-level approval state: `yes=bool(yes)` now flows into both nested CLI calls, and `defaults=bool(yes)` only bypasses interactive config-init review when the user truly invoked the startup path with `--yes`. This keeps the existing fully non-interactive behavior for explicit `--yes`, while allowing the normal config/vm/dependency prompts to appear during interactive bootstrap on a fresh machine.

I added a regression test in `tests/test_cli_vm_update.py` that simulates the missing-store bootstrap path with interactive consent and asserts the nested `InitCLI` / `VMCreateCLI` calls receive `yes=False` and `defaults=False`. I also re-ran the focused VM update test module (`pytest -q tests/test_cli_vm_update.py -q`), which passed cleanly.

Reflection/state of mind: this was a satisfying bug to fix because the user-provided trace narrowed it down to an intent-propagation mistake rather than a detection failure. The key tradeoff is that interactive bootstrap may now show a couple more standard prompts than before, but that is the correct UX here because those prompts carry meaningful choices the user did not auto-approve globally.

Uncertainties/risks: low, but worth watching whether anyone had come to rely on the old "single high-level yes implies silent nested defaults acceptance" behavior during interactive runs. I think preserving literal `--yes` semantics is the safer contract, and the added test should keep that boundary stable.
## 2026-03-18 16:41:36 +0000

Implemented the larger subprocess/sudo/logging redesign requested after reading the full fresh-start bootstrap log. The log made the UX problem very concrete: the system was narrating one privileged command at a time, repeatedly restating the same broad purpose, and making it hard to understand multi-command steps like host dependency install, network bring-up, and cloud-init preparation. I introduced a new object-oriented orchestration layer in `aivm/commands.py` with `CommandManager`, `IntentScope`, `PlanScope`, `CommandHandle`, and command/plan dataclasses, then used `aivm/util.py::run_cmd()` as the migration seam so older call sites still work.

The manager is now the central command authority. It owns the intent stack, current plans, grouped approval behavior, and command execution. The important UX change is that plans render step-oriented previews: step title, nested breadcrumb context, why the step exists, and summaries of the commands in that step. Raw command lines are still logged, but as supporting detail instead of the only narrative. Approval now usually happens once per step/plan rather than once per command. I kept the old ambient sudo-intent helpers only as a compatibility shim for unmigrated paths.

I migrated the highest-value noisy flows first:
- `aivm/host.py::install_deps_debian` now runs as one grouped host-dependency step.
- `aivm/net.py::ensure_network` now separates network inspection from the define/autostart/start step.
- `aivm/vm/lifecycle.py::_ensure_qemu_access` now groups directory prep into one storage-preparation plan.
- I also migrated `aivm/vm/lifecycle.py::_write_cloud_init` and `aivm/firewall.py::apply_firewall` because Jon explicitly called out noisy heredoc/payload-heavy logging, and those paths benefit a lot from summary-first step previews.

I updated CLI initialization to activate a fresh manager per invocation, adjusted logging setup so pytest/captured-stderr sessions do not keep writing to stale log sinks, and documented the new model in `README.rst` plus `docs/source/design.rst`, `quickstart.rst`, `security.rst`, and `workflows.rst`. The design doc now has an explicit command-orchestration section covering intent stack semantics, plan semantics, grouped approval boundaries, and migration expectations around `util.run_cmd()`.

Testing/refinement took a non-trivial second pass. The manager refactor changed the seam that many tests patched, so I rewrote the util-focused coverage around the new orchestration API and added the requested regressions: nested breadcrumb rendering, one approval prompt for a multi-command sudo plan, `CommandHandle.result()` flushing behavior, `run_cmd()` compatibility, read-only command role staying read-only inside a modifying parent intent, and clear failure for non-interactive sudo plans without approval flags. I also updated host/net/firewall/vm-helper tests to patch the central subprocess path instead of the old local wrappers.

Reflection/state of mind: this was a deeper architectural change than the earlier bootstrap bug, but the user guidance was unusually crisp and product-shaped, which made it feel like real UX engineering rather than abstract refactoring. I tried hard not to over-generalize: the manager is OO and centralized, but still simple and deterministic, and I resisted adding concurrency or fancy scheduling because the sequential model matches the repo and keeps approvals/logs understandable.

Uncertainties/risks: this is still a migration phase. Many call sites still use `run_cmd()` directly, so the full codebase will not instantly get ideal step-oriented UX unless those flows are migrated onto explicit plans/intents. There is also some judgment encoded in default role inference (`sudo + check=False` falls back to read when explicit role is absent); that is a practical default, but I would still prefer explicit command roles at important call sites over time. What I am confident about: the core subsystem is in place, the highest-noise flows are migrated, the docs describe the intended model, and the focused regression set is green (`pytest -q tests/test_util.py tests/test_host.py tests/test_net.py tests/test_firewall.py tests/test_cli_helpers.py tests/test_vm_helpers.py tests/test_cli_vm_update.py -q`).
## 2026-03-18 17:41:47 +0000

Follow-up after reviewing the new fresh-start log from a real `aivm ssh . -vvv` run. Two things stood out. First, the remaining attach path that is still on the compatibility execution seam was not using plan previews yet, so its UX remained command-granular. Second, the actual startup failure was not a logging issue at all: live virtiofs attach was treating libvirt's `Target already exists` response as a fatal error, even when the requested mapping was already present and the correct behavior was to treat the step as already satisfied.

I fixed the attach behavior in `aivm/vm/share.py::attach_vm_share(...)` by switching the attach call to inspect the non-zero result and special-case `Target already exists`. When that happens, the helper now re-reads current virtiofs mappings and returns success if the requested `(source, tag)` pair is already present. This makes repeated shortcut flows (`aivm ssh .`, `aivm code .`) idempotent in the common "already attached" case instead of failing and then prompting/retrying the exact same attach command again.

I also made a small but important log-level adjustment in `aivm/commands.py`: for planned steps, preview-time raw command lines are now `TRACE` instead of `DEBUG`. The plan preview still shows the step title, context, why, and summaries at `INFO`, while actual execution still emits the concrete `RUN [...]` line. This cuts down on duplicate raw-command noise without hiding it from operators who intentionally run at maximum verbosity.

Testing notes: added a regression test in `tests/test_vm_helpers.py` for the existing-mapping attach case, then reran the focused suites covering the touched areas (`tests/test_util.py`, `tests/test_vm_helpers.py`, `tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py`, `tests/test_cli_vm_update.py`; also the broader focused pack including host/net/firewall/helpers). Everything passed. There is still a pytest tempdir cleanup warning around the mocked cloud-init test fixture that appears to predate the behavioral change and does not fail the suite, but it is worth cleaning up separately if we want a warning-free focused run.

Reflection/state of mind: this was a good reminder that real logs expose different failure modes than unit-level reasoning. The new orchestration design was directionally right, but the old compatibility seam can still leak awkward UX until more of the attach/update path is migrated. I’m confident the attach idempotency fix is correct and that the preview-raw `TRACE` demotion better matches the "summaries first, raw commands still available" goal.
## 2026-03-18 17:47:59 +0000

Read the next fresh-start log iteration after the attach-idempotency fix. That run showed the earlier `virsh attach-device ... Target already exists` failure was resolved correctly, but it exposed a second, subtler bind-verification issue inside the guest shared-root reconcile logic. The remote verification script was only accepting sources that looked like `/mnt/aivm-shared/<tag>` or `none` with a matching `ROOT`, but on this host `findmnt` reported the bind source as `aivm-shared-root[/hostcode-aivm]`. That is a legitimate virtiofs-style source rendering and should be treated as equivalent to the expected guest path.

I updated `aivm/cli/vm.py::_ensure_shared_root_guest_bind(...)` so both the pre-existing mount check and the final verification step accept that normalized virtiofs source form (`aivm-shared-root[/<tag>]`) in addition to the previous accepted forms. I also added a regression assertion in `tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py` to lock the generated remote script to that expected-equivalence logic.

On the logging front, this latest log also helped confirm that the previous level adjustment was directionally right: probe `RUN:` lines remain visible at `DEBUG`, mutating commands remain visible at `INFO`, and plan-preview raw commands are no longer duplicated at `DEBUG`. The remaining verbosity awkwardness in the shortcut attach/rebind path is mostly because that part of the workflow is still using the compatibility sudo-intent seam rather than explicit plan scopes. That feels like follow-up migration work, not a log-level bug.

Validation: reran the focused attach/update/helper suites after the bind-source fix (`tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py`, `tests/test_cli_vm_update.py`, `tests/test_vm_helpers.py`) and they passed. I also kept seeing the existing pytest tempdir cleanup warning around the mocked cloud-init test fixture; still non-fatal, still worth a separate cleanup.
## 2026-03-18 20:10:34 +0000

Finished the highest-priority shared-root migration from the legacy per-command sudo prompt path onto the new `CommandManager`/`IntentScope`/`PlanScope` model. I started from the fresh-start log again because it made the remaining UX debt painfully obvious: repeated compat-style `Continue?` prompts, host bind work split across multiple isolated commands, and guest-side ssh/bash blobs doing too much explanatory work. The key refactor was to make the shared-root path itself become the step-oriented narrative rather than relying on the compatibility seam to paper over it.

Implementation details:
- In `aivm/cli/vm.py`, shared-root orchestration is now explicitly grouped around plans:
  - inspect shared-root host bind state
  - prepare host bind targets
  - inspect shared-root VM mapping
  - ensure VM virtiofs mapping
  - mount and verify inside guest
- `_ensure_attachment_available_in_guest(...)` now wraps shared-root work in an `IntentScope("Attach and reconcile shared-root mapping", ...)`, so the breadcrumb/context stays stable across those steps.
- `_ensure_shared_root_host_bind(...)` no longer uses `_confirm_sudo_block(...)`; it probes with a read plan and performs create/rebind work in a named modify plan. For stale bind replacement, I chose a summarized `bash -lc` repair action so the plan preview stays compact while raw shell remains available only at deeper verbosity.
- `_ensure_shared_root_vm_mapping(...)` now uses explicit inspect and ensure-mapping plans, and `attach_vm_share(...)` in `aivm/vm/share.py` plugs into that cleanly with semantic summaries.
- `_ensure_shared_root_guest_bind(...)` now submits two semantic guest-side actions inside one plan: mount shared-root inside guest, then bind/verify the requested guest destination. This keeps the giant guest script out of INFO-level narration.
- `_restore_saved_vm_attachments(...)` now routes shared-root restore through the same orchestration entrypoint as the main path, while preserving the existing non-disruptive-rebind safety for automatic restore.
- `_reconcile_attached_vm(...)` now uses the new shared-root helpers for running-VM live attach and uses a small step plan to create the shared-root parent dir before VM start/create. I added `ReconcileResult.shared_root_host_side_ready` so later guest reconciliation can avoid redoing host-side work when reconcile already completed it.

Docs were updated to better match reality rather than overclaim: shared-root `aivm ssh .` / `aivm code .` is now explicitly described as the strongest example of grouped-step UX, while older compatibility-seam flows are called out as still in migration.

Reflection/state of mind: this felt like the “make the architecture true in the product” phase. The command manager already existed, but until the shared-root attach/reconcile path actually used it, the flagship startup UX still felt old and noisy. I’m happier with the current shape because the steps now map much more directly to a human mental model of what `aivm` is doing.

Uncertainties/risks: the biggest tradeoff is that some stale-host-bind repair now uses a compact `bash -lc` action to keep the preview coherent. I think that is the right UX choice here because the semantic step is what matters at INFO, but it does mean the low-level repair sequence is mostly a TRACE/debug concern. There are also still remaining `_confirm_sudo_block(...)` usages elsewhere in `aivm/cli/vm.py` (shared mode, detach paths, VM/network/firewall/create/recreate flows, etc.); those are now more clearly the remaining migration surface.

What might break: tests that monkeypatch `run_cmd()`-level seams will continue to need migration as shared-root paths move onto the manager. I already had to rewrite several helper tests to patch `aivm.commands.subprocess.run` and to assert on step previews instead of raw command loops.

What I am confident about: the shared-root happy path is substantially more step-oriented now, the focused and adjacent command-manager/CLI suites are green (`pytest -q tests/test_util.py tests/test_host.py tests/test_net.py tests/test_firewall.py tests/test_cli_helpers.py tests/test_vm_helpers.py tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py tests/test_cli_vm_update.py -q`), and touched Python files compile. The lingering pytest tempdir cleanup warning around the cloud-init test fixture is still present but remains non-fatal and unrelated to this migration.
## 2026-03-18 20:28:53 +0000

Fixed a status-reporting regression in the non-sudo path. The user report was very clear: `aivm status` was honestly saying the VM/libvirt probes were unavailable without sudo, but then it immediately turned that inconclusive state into `VM not defined`, marked the cached IP as stale, and skipped SSH/provisioning checks that could still succeed without privileges. That made the output feel broken and self-contradictory next to `aivm status --sudo`.

Implementation details:
- In `aivm/status.py::probe_vm_state(...)`, I changed the second return value from effectively boolean to tri-state (`True` / `False` / `None`). Permission-denied / auth-failed / non-sudo-inconclusive VM probes now return `defined=None` instead of pretending the VM is absent.
- In `aivm/status.py::render_status(...)`, I updated downstream handling so:
  - `VM shared folders` says `unverified without privileged VM checks` instead of `VM not defined` when the VM state is unknown without sudo.
  - cached IP is kept as a neutral/inconclusive fact (`not verified without privileged VM checks`) instead of being marked stale.
  - SSH readiness and provisioning now still run when a cached IP exists, even if VM/libvirt state was inconclusive without sudo.
- Added a new regression in `tests/test_cli_status_helpers.py` that exercises the full rendered non-sudo status text and locks in the distinction between “unknown without sudo” and “actually not defined”.

Reflection/state of mind: this was a good reminder that tri-state status systems only help if we preserve the third state all the way to the UI. The bug wasn’t that the probes were conservative; it was that the renderer collapsed uncertainty into a stronger negative claim than the code had actually established.

Uncertainties/risks: the VM shared-folder line is still conservative in one respect: without sudo, if the VM is known to exist but `dumpxml` is unavailable, the current text says `none detected or unavailable without --sudo`. That is honest, but if we want a more exact tri-state there too, a dedicated shared-folder probe helper would be the next cleanup.

What I am confident about: the user-visible contradiction is fixed in logic and covered by tests (`pytest -q tests/test_cli_status_helpers.py tests/test_util.py tests/test_cli_helpers.py -q`), and the touched files compile.
## 2026-03-18 20:42:26 +0000

Did a second pass on non-sudo status after seeing fresh real output. The first fix preserved the tri-state correctly, but the UX was still too pessimistic: we were showing `VM state` as unavailable even when the same status run had just successfully SSHed into the guest and checked provisioning. That was technically non-contradictory, but still not a good synthesis of the available evidence.

I updated `aivm/status.py::render_status(...)` so it computes SSH readiness before finalizing the VM summary and uses that as an inference signal. If libvirt VM state is unavailable without sudo but cached IP + SSH probe succeed, status now upgrades the VM line to something like `reachable over SSH (libvirt state unavailable without --sudo)`. In the same case, cached IP becomes a normal positive signal again, and the shared-folder line explicitly says the guest is reachable but host mapping inspection still needs privileged VM checks.

Reflection/state of mind: this is the version that feels much closer to what an operator actually wants. The point of status is not to preserve internal probe boundaries at all costs; it is to present the best justified picture of the system. If SSH is working, pretending we still have no idea whether the VM is effectively up is not helpful.

Uncertainties/risks: this is an inference, not a direct libvirt fact, so I made sure the wording stays explicit about where the uncertainty remains (`libvirt state unavailable without --sudo`). I think that is the right balance between honesty and usefulness.

What I am confident about: the new render-level behavior is covered by the updated status helper regression test, the focused suites still pass, and the touched files compile.
## 2026-03-18 21:01:34 +0000

Added an SSH bootstrap improvement for fresh machines: when an interactive workflow needs VM SSH access but `aivm` cannot find an identity/public-key pair, it now offers to create a dedicated keypair at `~/.ssh/id_aivm_ed25519` instead of assuming the user already has `id_ed25519` or silently failing later. I threaded this through the places where the user is already in a setup-minded flow: `aivm config init`, the running-VM attach path, and the `aivm ssh .` / `aivm code .` session-preparation path.

Implementation-wise, I kept the behavior aligned with the newer command UX rather than slipping back into ad hoc shelling out. The new helper lives in `aivm/cli/_common.py` so the policy is centralized: respect explicitly configured custom paths, adopt the dedicated `id_aivm_ed25519` key automatically if it already exists, prompt only in interactive mode unless `--yes` is present, and create the key through a small `CommandManager` plan (`mkdir ~/.ssh`, `chmod 700 ~/.ssh`, `ssh-keygen ...`). That keeps the operation readable and consistent with the broader step-oriented direction of the repo.

I also updated the config-init warning text to stop suggesting the generic `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` command, since that would undercut the whole “distinct name” intent. Focused tests now cover both the helper itself and the interactive `config init` flow that accepts the prompt and persists `id_aivm_ed25519` into config.

Reflection/state of mind: this one felt like a small UX affordance with outsized practical value. Fresh-machine setup failures are the exact moment where users are least interested in manually reverse-engineering missing prerequisites, so offering a distinct aivm-scoped keypair is a nice combination of convenience and safety. The only thing I stayed cautious about was not overriding partially configured custom SSH paths, because that crosses the line from helpful automation into surprising behavior.

Uncertainties/risks: right now the auto-create offer is deliberately limited to interactive setup/attach/session flows, not read-only commands like `status`. That feels right to me, but if there are other entry points that implicitly require guest SSH we may want to reuse the helper there too. I’m also assuming `ed25519` remains the preferred default for this project; that matches the existing guidance and tests.

What I am confident about: the dedicated-name behavior is implemented, it persists into config in the setup path, the focused tests pass (`pytest -q tests/test_cli_helpers.py tests/test_cli_config_init.py -q`), and the touched Python files compile.
## 2026-03-18 21:18:31 +0000

Finished the next UX-focused migration pass on the new command-manager model. The big behavioral fix was making block approval authoritative: once a `PlanScope` preview has been approved, commands in that approved block no longer fall through to the old compatibility sudo prompt path. That was the root cause of the frustrating “preview the step, then still ask Continue? per command” behavior the user called out. I also tightened preview rendering so each planned item now shows a human-meaningful summary plus an exact command line, instead of awkward combinations like `sudo Enable and start libvirtd service`.

I spent a lot of this session on the image path because it was a good example of how easy it is to keep the old command-stream UX alive by accident. `fetch_image()` now runs as an explicit `Fetch and verify base image` block, and I had to restructure it so the whole command sequence is queued before the first `.result()` call. Otherwise the manager could only preview the commands known at the first flush, which produced an incomplete plan and undermined the whole mental-model goal. The final version previews directory prep, stale temp cleanup, download/copy into staging, move into cache, and checksum verification as one coherent block. Shared-root host/VM/guest previews also now show exact commands cleanly while keeping big shell payloads out of the INFO-level explanation surface.

Documentation needed a reality-sync pass too. I updated the docs to describe the actual current behavior more precisely: step previews now show both semantic summaries and exact commands; `y` approves only the current block; `a` approves the current block and all later blocks; grouped approval is still bounded by the commands shown in the preview; and raw commands remain available at higher verbosity. I deliberately avoided claiming that every remaining flow in `aivm` is fully migrated, because there are still legacy `_confirm_sudo_block(...)` seams in older attach/detach/update/create paths outside the shared-root happy path.

Reflection/state of mind: this felt like the kind of refinement pass that makes an architecture real. The manager already existed, but until the approval boundary actually held and the previews genuinely taught the user what was about to happen, the product would still feel like the old system wearing a new jacket. I’m happy with the current state because the logs now do more explanatory work at the right level and less repetitive work at the wrong one.

Uncertainties/risks: there is still migration debt in `aivm/cli/vm.py` outside the shared-root happy path. The compatibility sudo helper remains in detach flows, some shared-mode restore paths, and a number of VM/network/firewall/create/update operations. Those are now more clearly the remaining surface rather than a hidden leak in the new model. The existing pytest tempdir cleanup warning around the mocked cloud-init fixture is still present and unrelated to this work.

What I am confident about: block approval semantics are now correct (`y` current block only, `a` current plus later blocks), approved plans no longer trigger compat per-command prompts, previews show both summaries and exact commands, the shared-root happy path remains grouped, the image fetch/verify path is now grouped, docs match the implementation more closely, and the broader focused regression pack is green (`pytest -q tests/test_util.py tests/test_host.py tests/test_net.py tests/test_firewall.py tests/test_cli_helpers.py tests/test_cli_config_init.py tests/test_vm_helpers.py tests/test_cli_vm_attach.py tests/test_cli_vm_update.py -q`).
## 2026-03-18 21:46:12 +0000

This session focused first on the new safety regression, because the host shared-root ownership damage was more important than any of the approval UX polish. The core bug was in `aivm/vm/lifecycle.py::_ensure_qemu_access(...)`: it was recursively applying qemu ownership/perms to the VM root, and that root can contain `shared-root/<token>` bind targets. Once a bind mount exists there, recursive `chown -R` or similar permission repair does not just touch an internal staging directory; it walks onto the user's real project tree through the bind and mutates the underlying inodes. I changed the model so qemu-access preparation is only recursive for clearly internal directories (`images/` and `cloud-init/`) and non-recursive for the VM root itself. That keeps the internal VM storage layout prepared without treating bind-mounted exports as safe permission-repair territory.

I also extended the block-approval UX in `aivm/commands.py` with `s = show full exact commands for this block, then reprompt`, while preserving the existing semantics that `y` is current block only and `a` is current plus all later blocks. The important tradeoff here is readability versus auditability: previews should stay concise enough to build trust, but users still need a way to inspect the exact remote shell / heredoc / sudo payload before granting approval. The execution side stays fully auditable too, because the actual full command is still logged when it runs. I added caller-origin metadata to plans and commands so logs now say who submitted the work, which feels much more useful than seeing only `aivm.commands` as the source of every action.

State of mind / reflection: this felt like a good example of why UX and safety are intertwined in this repo. The same refactor that makes the step previews nicer can accidentally make people less skeptical if the underlying host behavior is unsafe, so it was important to stop and fix the ownership regression before polishing the prompt flow further. I feel much better about the direction now because the permission model is narrower and more explicit, and the approval model gives users a readable summary plus an escape hatch to inspect the full literal commands.

Uncertainties/risks: the biggest remaining uncertainty is migration debt outside the shared-root happy path. There are still old `_confirm_sudo_block(...)` seams in some detach/create/update flows, and they are now more clearly the next cleanup target. I am also relying on a policy choice that preserving the user's source tree is more important than auto-repairing libvirt accessibility for every conceivable host layout; if a future environment really does require ownership mutation to make a share usable, the right response is a clear failure, not silent modification of the project tree.

What I am confident about: the root cause of the host ownership regression is understood and the narrow fix is in place, the command manager now supports `s` for full current-block inspection, submitter attribution is visible in preview/run logs, and the focused regression additions should protect against sliding back into recursive qemu prep on bind-mounted shared-root paths.
